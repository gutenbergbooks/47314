<p>Circumstances have induced an Individual, who wishes to remain
unknown, to offer a Prize of £100, to be competed for by Members
of the University of Oxford of not less standing than Master of Arts,
and by any above that standing, for the best Essay in confutation of
the Materialism of the present day by arguments derived from Evidences
of Intelligence, Design, Contrivance, and Adaptation of Means
to Ends, in the Universe, and especially in Man considered in his
Moral Nature, his Religious Aptitudes, and his Intellectual Powers;
and in all Organic Nature. The observation also to be made and
supported in the course of the Essay that the Will and Wisdom of
the Creator may be a sufficient cause for deviations from the established
course of nature, and that the Free-will of man, in things within his
power and influence, may be a cause of similar deviations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is desired that all arguments used against Materialism should be
independent of those of Hegel, and of what is called the Spiritual Philosophy,
which had its rise in Germany.</p>

<p>A period of two years will be allowed after the Public Announcement
of the subject before the competing Essays will be required to be sent in
to the Judges: and it is a condition of the competition that the Copyright
of the successful Essay shall be the property of the Donor of the
Prize; but that if published, the profits (if any) shall belong to the
Writer.</p>

<p>The Very Reverend the Dean of St. Paul's, the Regius Professor of
Divinity, and the Rev. C. Pritchard, Savilian Professor of Astronomy,
have consented to act as Judges.</p>

<p>Essays must be sent to the Registrar of the University on or before the
12th of June, 1872. The Essays are to be distinguished by mottoes, the
writer's name being sent at the same time in a sealed envelope, in the
manner prescribed for the Chancellor's Prizes.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The Essay now published is the expansion of a thin volume
by the present writer, which was printed more than four years
ago.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Natural Theology, considered as a science, had been
at that time pronounced extinct and impossible by very
eminent authorities. From this decision I felt myself constrained
to differ; and thought it worth while to put on
record a plea for what appeared to me an unduly neglected
branch of Philosophy.</p>

<p>Such contempt of a pursuit possessing so many claims on
the favourable attention of educated minds, seemed a fact
to be accounted for in some way. After considerable thought,
I ventured on asserting that the method latterly employed
in treatises on this once popular science, furnished the true
reason of its decline and fall. That method I could not avoid
condemning as both inadequate and suicidal.</p>

<p>The publication of my Sermon in 1870, was followed by a
number of letters and critiques from scientific and literary
men. Not one amongst them alleged any worse fault than
novelty against the matter of my book, and undue compression
against its manner. Many of their remarks were of
the most encouraging description, and affected me deeply by
reason of the celebrity of their writers, whom I had previously
known only by their works and their reputation. One most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
generous letter from the Author who, above all others, had
called my own intellectual life into active energy, excited, in
my mind, a warmth of feeling absolutely indescribable.</p>

<p>When, therefore, a Prize on this subject was offered for
adjudication subject to the appointment of my own University,
I felt glad to embrace an occasion which might be called in the
truest sense an "Opportunity." What I have produced is to
be found in the following pages. When engaged in writing
them, it was my most anxious wish and endeavour to be
<em>honest</em>: to advocate what I thought and still think true,
without disguising the difficulties of my own conclusion, or
assailing its antagonists by gratuitous insinuations or unfairnesses
of any sort. Should such a meanness appear, I would
earnestly desire the leaf on which it is printed to be torn
from my book.</p>

<p>The delays which have befallen these pages since they were
first sent to press in the former half of 1873, have caused
much regret to both author and publishers. Our troubles
began with a singular misadventure to a quantity of MS.;
which, together with other circumstances, delayed printing
till after the time originally fixed for publication. The next
season was lost in consequence of severe domestic affliction.
Those of my readers who have ever gone into print, will most
readily commiserate the anxiety caused by such unlooked for
disappointments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ensuing line of argument was suggested to my mind
when a young Oxonian, in consequence of circumstances with
which it is needless to trouble my readers. What I then
thought its special strength, lay in the point of its combining
two totally different kinds of proof:&mdash;one, drawn from a survey
of the world we live in,&mdash;the other, from what is nearer to
ourselves&mdash;the moral truth given us by our personal consciousness.
I also thought that any particular weakness alleged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
against one proof, could not be incident to the other; and,
therefore, that since both lines of evidence, (kept apart while
under examination), met at last in one and the same result,
my inquiry had arrived at a demonstrably certain conclusion.
At the same time, I could not but feel a wholesome distrust of
my reasonings on a subject, which, though often discussed, had
never, as I then believed, been looked at exactly from my own
point of view.</p>

<p>Somewhat later in life, I learned from Paley's commentators
and continuators, that the attack and defence of Natural
Theology had for years been conformed to the position taken
up by the Archdeacon, so far at least as the popular science of
this country was concerned. But the sceptical tactics of Hume
shewed me a much wider plan of assault; and in studying his
great German antagonist I saw that a double line of defence
had been contemplated by him. I have since observed that
no part of Kant's philosophy is less commonly known to
English readers than his method and results in those most
priceless of his critical investigations, the treatises forming a
ground-work of Moral Science. As may at once be supposed,
the discovery that I really had a sort of sympathiser in Kant,
was the greatest possible encouragement to my mind.</p>

<p>Yet there remained a very heavy discouragement. Evidently,
any one who should try to pursue two very separate but
convergent lines of reasoning, must undergo a most toilsome
task, and one little likely to be performed without long and
continued effort. And, harder yet to answer was the question
next following: Who will read your patiently obtained results,
to say nothing of the collateral topics which must in logical
fairness be argued by the way? After all, the inevitable
drawback to Natural Theology lies in the fact that, in order
to be held a valid science, it must necessarily become a
complex one.</p>

<p>This last difficulty remains my chiefest apprehension still.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
Neither in the Essay itself, nor yet in the additions made to
it, have I introduced any one point which it seemed permissible
to omit with justice to the real issue. Yet I dare not hope that
many eyes, except those of the practised student, will easily
perceive how germane to that issue are several among the
subjects discussed. One class of thinkers will, however,
welcome the whole of these inquiries; and this class contains
the earnest men for whom above all others I have written.</p>

<p>The amount of MS. sent to the Registrar was much less in
compass than the present volume. But Notes and Illustrations
were intended from the first, and, had there existed a doubt as
to their propriety, it would have been at once removed by the
counsel of competent advisers. The risks attaching to the
Essay in its smaller shape were said to be two: (1) An
evident appearance of unwilling brevity, and (2) a possible
charge of novel thought, bordering on paradox. In attempting
to overcome these obstacles to favourable attention, I have
pursued the following course:&mdash;</p>

<p>The text of the Essay is printed as originally written, with
only a very few verbal changes for the sake of improved
clearness. A number of foot-notes belonging to its first draft,
remain distinguished by the ordinary marks of reference.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In reperusing the text, I set myself to consider how many
sympathisers I could find. The best answer to any possible
charge of Paradox, seemed to be a roll-call of thinkers who,
for their own purposes, have asserted positions more or less
approaching those I had attempted to maintain. The number
of auxiliaries I have thus succeeded in assembling, is, I confess,
a matter of considerable self-gratulation. Yet, I do not appeal
to such opinions as <em>authorities</em>, in any other sense than so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
forth as they are the decisions of <em>experts</em> in different provinces
of knowledge. In whatever concerns his own department,
each scientific worker has assuredly a right to be heard. The
weight of confirmation thus given to my own previous results,
is enhanced by the fact that most of the authors cited, pursued
different objects from mine, and wrote without any bias favourable
to Natural Theology. Respecting more than one of them,
I feel inclined to repeat the ancient adage, "My antagonist has
become my helper."</p>

<p>The Quotations themselves have been divided into separate
classes. The greatest number illustrate particular expressions,
sentences, and paragraphs. These are arranged as foot-notes
on the several pages of Text, and are referred to by the <em>small</em>
letters of the alphabet. Others, explaining or confirming
principles, of general importance to the argument, have been
distinguished by <em>capital</em> letters, and placed at the end of the
chapters to which they appertain. With this latter division
are classed a third set of extracts, which aim at expounding
certain special thoughts, and opening out to the real student
useful paths of prolonged investigation.</p>

<p>One circumstance connected with the Additional Notes, is
alluded to at the bottom of page 27. Originally, I had made
only a few citations from thoroughly sceptical writers. But,
against this plan were urged the following objections. (1.) In
arguing questions of all kinds, definite points are present to the
mind of every disputant, and against them he directs his argument.
His expressions are always antithetic to these points,
and should they be left in the shadow, all antithesis is lost, and
the real force of the argument obscured. Sometimes it is even
mistaken;&mdash;a truth which may be illustrated by comparing the
positions of great leaders in politics or theology with the positions
occupied by their disciples. The former always speak by
way of antithesis,&mdash;the latter seldom construe their leaders'
words antithetically. Hence, the disciples never fail to outrun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
their teachers. Antithesis is in truth a verbal counterpoise;
and where it disappears, balance is not seldom overthrown.
Thus, said my advisers, your reasoning must necessarily suffer
by a general loss of clear definition. Again, (2) they continued;&mdash;Since
the time when you began your Essay, Scepticism
in general, Materialism and Mechanism in particular, or, to
speak briefly, the various denials of Theism, have ceased to be
subjects on which reticence is feasible. An Address of Mr.
Gladstone's delivered in a room, and spoken to a company of
youths, soon became world-wide; it has been, and will be
read, quoted, and commented on, wheresoever the English
language is understood. One daily newspaper attractively
written, devotes many of its clever pages to making known
in a forensic manner the many different phases of sceptical
opinion. And some religious journals explain, with complete
freedom, what the disbeliefs are which they consider most
reprehensible. Reticence, therefore, is simply thrown away.
Some may desire to see it practised towards young people, but
such "economizers" are, in effect, theoretical. They forget
that the Battle of Thought comes to educated young minds
along with the Battle of Life; and woe to the unprepared
either way! They become, one and all, bewildered.</p>

<p>These reasons have satisfied my own judgment up to a
certain point. I have consequently added <em>such</em> quotations
from sceptical authors, as seemed desirable for the purpose of
<em>limiting</em> my several positions with antithetic distinctness; a
kind of definition which I admit to be the most distinct of all.
And to these extracts I have appended some others, plainly
expressing the conclusions which the opponents of Theism
<em>ought</em> to reach, provided their views are carried out with fairness
and consistency. Conclusions of this kind can only be
obtained from Sceptics themselves. In what are called "logical
consequences" put by an author into the mouth of his adversaries,
I, for one, have no confidence whatever. To draw such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
inferences and glory in their wrong-headedness, is like inventing
both sides of a controversial dialogue, defeating the party
destined to defeat, and then laying claim to a philosophic
victory. Or, we may take the reverse supposition. A writer
is too honest for such ill-gotten triumph. This same quality
of candour will, most probably, induce him to put the case he
opposes in a light so advantageous, as to throw fresh doubt
upon his own.</p>

<p>If, then, I have erred in over-quoting upon these accounts, I
cannot plead that the error is committed unadvisedly.</p>

<p>It seems right to say, that, in mustering auxiliaries, I found
the best friends to my argument were the most truly philosophic
Biologists. It would indeed be strange and sad, should
the genuine leaders of thought in any among the Natural
Sciences be reckoned real adversaries of Natural Theology.
But, in order to convey an exact impression to the reader's
mind, I must beg him to peruse, in connection with this statement,
the note on Materialism appended to Chapter III.; and,
more particularly, its concluding pages. Towards the hybrid
class mentioned p. 246, I cannot help entertaining a sentiment
the reverse of complimentary.</p>

<p>To several distinguished persons who have bestowed upon
this undertaking the aids of advice or sympathy, I offer a
tribute of respectful gratitude. In one particular they will, I
hope, think their kindness not utterly thrown away; since,
unlike many recipients of good counsel, I have followed the
opinions given me. It is with a deep solemnity of emotion,
I thus venture on recording my heartfelt indebtedness. One,
who was glad that words of his had helped me, now adorns
no longer the noblest of assemblies by his eloquence. To my
personal sorrow, he will not cast a glance on the pages over
which his favour threw a ray of encouragement.</p>

<p>That same last change, O half-sceptical yet whole-earnest
Reader, awaits both thee and myself. To thee, I am no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
than the unseen utterer of certain thoughts, nourished through
a period of blended hope and anxiety. It is now thine, to
take unto thyself such reasonings as may fairly lay claim to
some serious consideration. It is mine to accept the mixed
consequences of their utterance;&mdash;the kindness and contempt
which follow believing advocacy always. Through all, and
above all, there will remain with me&mdash;and perchance with
thee also&mdash;the sense of a new Responsibility.</p>

<p>These two shares in this slight book on the largest of subjects,
belong in a fashion to earnest reader and anxious author
for the time present. Soon they will be ours, and not ours.
As days pass by, thought and utterance will bring less to both
of us. We shall both have tinctured our lives more deeply
with the Divine, or the Not-Divine; we shall both have sealed
the secret fountains of our hearts, in readiness for the Grave
and its inevitable Futurities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>&#8258;"Natural Theology attempts to demonstrate the existence
of a personal First Cause, supreme Reason, and
Will. The relations of mankind towards such a Being,
are called natural religion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We look upon the starry heavens and say, <em>as</em> man
creates within his own soul, and gives to airy nothing a
thought, a name, a purpose, and a reality, <em>so</em> Almighty
God created the Divine poem of this universal frame;
His will is its substance, His majestic thought and
purpose shine out in its adornment, and we&mdash;we are
hidden in the hollow of His hand. Every marvel of
the visible raises our sense of the infinite variety and
beauty of the invisible, until, attracted by Him Who is
the first mover of the outward and the inward alike,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
we make of this wonderful orb we tread upon a solid
ground of support from which to mount, to fly to God
and be at rest."</p></blockquote>

<p>These paragraphs are taken from the Appendix to my little
volume on Natural Theology alluded to in the beginning of
this Preface. They were intended as comments on the words
with which the Sermon itself concluded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have only to add that time could not permit my
carrying this fruitful subject beyond its obscure and
dry first principles. There is a brighter district of
thought, an upland territory, as it were, rising towards
our highest inheritance; a border country where
Natural Theology melts into Spiritual Religion, and
where the true offspring of God learn the lineaments
of their Father's divine love. I turn with regret from
this land of living light."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such, then, were the feelings with which I could not help
regarding the scientific limits of Natural Theology. I felt it
nothing less than a disappointment to traverse the paths of
positive fact and argument, and to close just at the very point
where the human head gains a response from the human heart.
It seemed like the task of a landscape painter, who, after
depicting successive plains made shadowy by tangled brushwood
and dark forest-growth, should be compelled to lay down
his pencil, and forbear transferring to his canvas the beautiful
downs and sun-lighted hills overlooking those more obscure
regions. Compared with the painter's regrets, were mine, I
asked, less natural? The attributes of Deity already dwelt
upon through the chain of my argument, were not only fitted
to bring His existence home to Reason, but also to move
earnest spirits by a strong sense of elevated hopes and duties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
devotion and aspiration. These religious sentiments might
have yielded the purest lights of my landscape. All that had
gone before seemed more negative than affirmative;&mdash;rather
to have been sketched in neutral tints than in radiant and
glowing colours.</p>

<p>A similar feeling of deep concern attended the conclusion
of the present Essay; increased by an inevitable thought that
the reiterated disappointment seemed likely to be a disappointment
always. It was, therefore, a very great gratification to
find in the honour of an election to the Bampton Lectureship
for 1875, the possibility of adding a crown and completion to
all my foregone work. The scheme of these Lectures enables
me to treat of Natural Religion; to penetrate the upland
territory, the border country where Man may view, as he
walks heavenwards, the lineaments of his Father's Divine
love.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before this time next year, I may, therefore, hope to have
realized my purpose. The volume of Bampton Lectures for
1875, may then have become the appropriate conclusion of
this present book.</p>

<p class="center"><big>CHAPTER I</big>.</p>

<p class="center">INTRODUCTORY.</p>


<p>No subjects of thought have ever been proposed more essential
to the culture and happiness of mankind than the two following
inquiries.</p>

<p>Upon the first, human minds dwell unweariedly through
every change of circumstance from childhood to advanced age.
It is this:&mdash;What reason have we to look for a future life after
that hour of dissolution which inevitably awaits us all?</p>

<p>The second question unites itself closely, as by indissoluble
links, to the first. We always proceed to ask, Is there sufficient
ground for believing in the existence of a Supreme Moral
Being, to whose righteous care and kindness we can calmly
commit ourselves when we come to die?</p>

<p>Suppose any man to maintain that the universe we inhabit,&mdash;and
we who are a portion of its occupants&mdash;came into existence
by chance, he renounces at once every right and title to
expect a life succeeding his bodily death. Chance&mdash;if the word
means anything&mdash;means absolute uncertainty; and from that
which is in its own nature uncertain, what continuing effects,
what conclusive expectation, can be drawn?</p>

<p>Neither is the prospect improved by Materialists<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>, in whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
opinion the being of man comprehends no element differing
essentially, and in kind, from the natural world he rules over.
We see actually consequent upon every death-bed the decay of
our material frame; if, therefore, that frame be not the casket
of a brighter jewel, we can assuredly affirm no hope higher or
happier than corruption.</p>

<p>The feelings of most human beings revolt from a destiny so
ignoble. And many persons are satisfied that this revolt of
feeling is in itself a sufficient ground for some belief in Immortality.
Why, they ask, should so powerful an instinct dwell
in the breast of our race with only a misleading issue? The
higher instincts of creatures below us do not mislead them regarding
that which is to come. Insects innumerable make provision
for the certain sustenance of a progeny they never can
live to behold. They also anticipate for themselves a futurity
of life and development. The caterpillar invests himself with
the web he has spun, and sinks into a chrysalid-sepulchre, to
emerge from it in sun-lighted beauty. Can any valid reason
be assigned why the intuitive aspirations of man should be
more fallacious than such practical foresights of the merely
animal world below him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>So far as the writer of these pages is aware, no one
has ever alleged a reason why mankind should be thus
deluded. And without going further than our own country,
it seems probable that this instinctive persuasion is seldom
wanting amongst the greater part of our people. Although
the moral consequences of such a persuasion, sometimes
merely passive, may be far less than good men could desire,
yet they are frequently strong enough to assist the weak
and wavering when exposed to sudden temptations. In
the "short and simple annals of the poor," may be read
countless instances of the fact. Neglected men and women,
the scorned outcasts of society, have been often held back
by it from greater criminality. They have found themselves
unable to acquiesce in the belief of <em>their</em> world's opinion&mdash;the
opinion of their evil friends and companions&mdash;that
death must be to all creatures the certain end of all
things.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, absolute knowledge of a future state
were the natural gift of each person's understanding, there are
thousands amongst our educated classes to whom the trial and
terror of their own hearts would be incalculably mitigated.
Numbers feel that speculative doubts concerning the Being of
a God, and life after death, are sources of a continual perplexity
and distress, under which they find little or no sympathy. In
every fresh affliction or anxiety, such a mind has to sustain a
double burden of sorrow, and concerning such it seems emphatically
true, that "the heart knoweth his own bitterness." There
may, however, be suggested one alleviation for every similar
instance of despondency. The same rule holds in this respect
as in all human pursuits,&mdash;labour is, and will always continue,
the appointed path by which we must attain. The more noble
the object sought, the more arduous the task and toil,&mdash;and
what can be nobler than a well-grounded belief in God and
Immortality?</p>

<p>Another very large class of educated persons bear their
doubts with stoical composure, account them an inevitable
burden, and consider it lost time to ask questions concerning
"the Unknowable." This class is sustained in its attitude by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the prevalence<a name="FNanchor_B_4" id="FNanchor_B_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_4" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> of really sceptical writings;&mdash;writings (that
is) which deny the possibility of knowledge beyond the circle
of positive phenomena. Maxims to this effect are not uncommonly
disseminated through the periodical press, books of
fiction, and other kinds of light literature. The rapidity of
modern life leads men to take opinions upon trust, and keeps
them back from serious investigation. An ephemeral satirist
becomes in their eyes as valuable an authority as the most
deeply-thinking reasoner. Much work is saved by this valuation,
to say nothing of the great gain in self-complacency. And,
no doubt, many persons feel particularly complacent in taking
their tone from minds which are evidently no better informed,
and no more finely strung than their own<a name="FNanchor_C_5" id="FNanchor_C_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_5" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>.</p>

<p>The class of sceptics just described, cannot be reckoned in
figures. They make up multitudes never enumerated apart in
any religious census. They live and die and make no sign,&mdash;and
how can quiet unavowed disbelief obtain a separate place
in the columns of the Registrar-General? Among the audible
tones of respectable people it finds no utterance, and therefore
occupies no position. Every one experienced in the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
knows that this species of Indifferentism is usually regular at
public worship, and reticent where sceptical phrases pass current.
The only sure test is a moral one&mdash;of very slow application,
since it takes time for a decent sceptic to balance the
pleasures against the risks of immorality. Meantime, there
remains some possible hope for a happier choice during the
period of indecision.</p>

<p>Far fewer, because far more strongly declared, are the literary
lodestars of that harbourless sea, where all beyond the horizon
of cloud and billow seems veiled and uncertain. Some amongst
them may, after all, be but wandering lights themselves<a name="FNanchor_D_6" id="FNanchor_D_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_6" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>,
floating and drifting like meteors which glimmer at nightfall
across shadowy waters. Others appear really fixed in a dim
and joyless firmament where the Present only is true, the
remote Past a conjecture, and the Future altogether inscrutable.
According to them this bounded prospect is the true goal
and real aim of our transitory life,&mdash;within it the trials and
griefs of humanity assume their proper dimensions and pale
their ineffectual terrors, while peace, like a river of Eden, flows
out over the once martyred but now ransomed race of man.
Even in our own imperfect struggling day, the human creature
may be happy who certainly knows that this mixed existence
is his All&mdash;that outside it he can live no life except in the
memory of his fellow-men&mdash;that there is no God, no futurity
of individual progress or perfection; but that one thing happens
equally to the good and the bad&mdash;the wise and the unwise. This
knowledge brings happiness, because it chases from the breast
self-centred hope and fear: the man who accepts this blank
beholds himself, as he really is, an atom of the Universal
Whole&mdash;borne now by the irresistible tide of force into sunlight&mdash;borne
soon by the same irresistible tide into a darkness
of the shadow of death.</p>

<p>Compared with this creed, the martyrs of Monotheism were
self-loving&mdash;for did not they hope? Compared with this
simple creed, all who have stopped short on the threshold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
frightful crimes, and hesitated to stain their souls, were also
self-loving&mdash;for did they not fear?</p>

<p>A great variety of remonstrances have been addressed to
writers of this latter type<a name="FNanchor_E_7" id="FNanchor_E_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_7" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>. Social consequences have been
eloquently urged against hypotheses which, if realised, would
weaken, or perhaps destroy, self-control, foresight, and self-improvement.
In reply we are told that these objects of pursuit
still appear good and useful to benevolent eyes. But it should
be remembered that our age is one of transition&mdash;half-developed
as it were in Doubt. Our benevolent men have not yet been
fully disciplined in the coming school. Who, therefore, shall
safely predict for us the effects of its proposed discipline? Add
that, looking at the civilised world in general, certain ideas
(illusions, as they are sometimes called) respecting a Futurity
influenced by our present right and wrong-doing, are ingrained
in cultured man, and may perhaps be described as connate
with his nineteenth-century existence<a name="FNanchor_F_8" id="FNanchor_F_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_8" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>. Is it possible, then,
for any one to say beforehand what may or may not be the
consequence of uprooting cherished principles fitted in their
own nature to exercise so practical an influence?</p>

<p>Remonstrances of this kind, however truthful and valuable
in themselves, would be out of place in the ensuing pages. A
contribution to the constructive science of Natural Theology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
must rest its arguments upon the reason of the case, to the exclusion
of many interesting and persuasive considerations. All
questions of Sociology, have, however, a special fascination for
numerous thinkers who are unlikely to overlook negative conclusions
lying close upon the confines of their own science, and
to them the treatment of such questions must be remitted.</p>

<p>That these phases of thought have not, in fact, escaped the
consideration of benevolent observers, may be inferred from the
special circumstances under which this Essay is composed. Into
every condition (each being required by the exigencies of the
subject) the present writer enters with honest cordiality. His
wish and aim is to place before those who, while they doubt,
still debate, certain reasonable considerations which have appeared
convincing to other speculative minds. And he may
defend himself from any possible charge of causeless intermeddling
with other men's concerns, in the words of one amongst
our most genuinely English poets:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"'Twere well, says one sage, erudite, profound,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Terribly arch'd and aquiline his nose,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">And overbuilt with most impending brows,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">'Twere well could you permit the World to live</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">As the World pleases: what's the World to you?</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Much. I was born of woman, and drew milk</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">As sweet as charity from human breasts.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">I think, articulate, I laugh and weep,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">And exercise all functions of a man.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">How then should I and any man that lives</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Be strangers to each other?"<a name="FNanchor_3_9" id="FNanchor_3_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_9" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are, however, doubters whom the writer can scarcely
desire to address&mdash;human beings in whose hearts to deny God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
kindles a vivid delight, because belief in Him would compel the
renunciation of some darling wickedness. The true spring of
their Materialism, Pantheism,&mdash;or whatever else happens to be
the adopted form of Negation&mdash;lies within the will<a name="FNanchor_G_10" id="FNanchor_G_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_10" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> itself.
And, therefore, the wish to be better must precede the wish to
hear any one who reasons of righteousness, temperance, or
judgment to come.</p>

<p>To those who doubt, yet desire that Truth&mdash;whichever way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Truth may incline&mdash;shall distinctly prevail, the ensuing pages
are dedicated. And one main endeavour to be kept in view
by both writer and reader is, that, laying aside passion and
prejudice, these questions may be discussed under the <i lang="la">siccum
lumen</i>&mdash;the purified ray&mdash;of Right Reason. To argue for victory
may be allowed an advocate who pleads subject to the intervention
of a judge. But here we have no arbiter to say what
is or is not allowable; here, too, the matter is in itself something
graver than corporeal life, or death, or all else beneath
the sky; here, finally, the case is personal, since each reasoner
first settles an account with his own heart; next, tries and
decides a conclusive issue, and by his own sentence, accepts
more than any human foresight can declare. Here, then, special
pleading<a name="FNanchor_4_11" id="FNanchor_4_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_11" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is altogether out of place on either side, and we
must, if we aim at what is best, argue for nothing more or less
than the plain and simple truth.</p>

<p>There must, of course, be difficulties in keeping this straight
and honest road. Few men like making admissions apparently
at variance with their own conclusions; fewer still like to
forego pleas which, though in their own judgment unsound,
are certainly specious, and to many minds persuasive. Such,
however, is the wish and aim of the present essayist. And,
that he may bind himself the more firmly to his own resolution,
he requests his readers to believe that any over-statement
or other error of which he may fairly be found guilty, is occasioned
by the unpleasantly common cause of ignorance,&mdash;a
cause which Dr. Johnson confessed was his reason for defining
"<em>pastern</em>" as a "horse's knee." "Ignorance, madam, pure
ignorance," he replied, to the surprise of his fair critic, who
expected an elaborate defence. <i lang="la">Per contra</i>, the essayist may
equitably claim that he shall not be convicted by a too summary
and inconsiderate process. At the first blush, there will
certainly appear in the eyes of many readers numerous seeming
mistakes, which, if carefully scrutinized, may afterwards be
held the reverse. At all events, plain dealing and honest
purpose demand that, when Truth is the issue truly sought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
those who approach it from opposite sides must (if they desire
to do right) sift their objections and difficulties as well as their
favourite arguments.</p>

<p>Reasoning on Natural Theology falls necessarily into two
divisions. The <em>first</em> is made up of arguments drawn from the
world without us. The <em>second</em>, of arguments drawn from the
world within<a name="FNanchor_H_12" id="FNanchor_H_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_12" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>. Each path of reasoning is subject to a cross
division. We may argue affirmatively to a definite conclusion.
We may also argue negatively with the same end in view;&mdash;we
may show how much more difficult and less tenable is the contradictory
hypothesis.</p>

<p>It would be an awkward and almost impracticable task to
keep these kinds of reasoning far apart. The natural procedure
of thought, is to combine, rather than to dissever, when we
marshal facts for the purpose of a full and wide generalization.
Yet it does seem practicable to mark every transition of thought
distinctly; and, if clearly marked, the distinction may easily
be kept in mind.</p>

<p>With this precaution, it may appear allowable to treat
Natural Theology in a more discursive manner than could
otherwise be permitted. The object of so doing will be to
divest discussion as much as possible of a dry, logical stiffness;
and, by ranging round each topic<a name="FNanchor_I_13" id="FNanchor_I_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_13" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> to look at it in various
lights; a process which generally discovers both the weakness
and the strength of reasoning. Any one who has read Plato
will understand the advantage of Dialogue in this respect. A
more familiar book, Coleridge's "Friend," is another apt illustration.
Each of its series of essays takes a sweep of the kind;
and each "landing-place" affords a rest to the reader, and a
fresh beginning to the intellectual tour. Without venturing to
copy the quaint invention of landing-places, the present writer
intends making every Chapter the occasion of a fresh <em>start</em>.
The separate trains of thought will thus proceed from distinct
points, and travel by separate routes, so as to admit of full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
inspection in their progress. Each argument allowed by the
reader to be valid, will finally link itself to its neighbours; and
all thoughtful persons know how to estimate the strength of
convergent conclusions.</p>

<p>The writer trusts, also, that he may be allowed to escape
the two alternatives,&mdash;either circumlocution, or the use of an
objectionable pronoun <em>singular</em>, by employing the plural "<em>we</em>."
This word may perhaps have a further good effect; it may
remind both reader and writer that they are engaged as pilgrim-companions
on a journey of joint exploration.</p>

<p>At the head of all their reasonings, Natural Theologians
usually place the celebrated argument from Design. It would
be impossible, in discussing it, to reproduce here the many illustrative
examples of Design which have been collected. It would
likewise be useless; partly, because they are all easily accessible
and mostly well known; partly, because their appositeness as
<em>illustrations</em> is now fully admitted; and the controversy turns
upon questions of another and more abstract kind. It is asked
whether the analogy founded on these instances is relevant?&mdash;whether
it proves too little, or too much?&mdash;and, how far the
inferences drawn from such examples really go? Our plan
will, therefore, be to devote our second Chapter to the examination
of such objections; to the review and elucidation of the
argument from Design. But if the reader wishes really to
study the various questions closely connected with this celebrated
line of thought, and to view the reasoning in a shape so
complete as to be at once relevant and satisfactory, he may
be pleased to bestow a leisure hour on the consecutive perusal
of Chapters II., V., and VI., with their appended notes and
illustrations.</p>

<p>The <em>third</em> Chapter is intended as a critical propædeutic or
foundation for the constructive science of Natural Theology.
So far as our experience of men in great cities teaches anything
with respect to the speculative difficulties which keep
them from God, it seems to teach one undoubted fact. There
is grounded in their minds a persuasion (underlying all further
objections), that, whatever else we can know, little or nothing
is to be learned concerning God. The idea of Theism is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
isolated from every other idea; and there is a presumption
against all reasoning which in any way leads up to a determinate
thought of the Divine Being or the Divine attributes.</p>

<p>Some such doubters allege the necessary limitation of human
knowledge in general:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Know then thyself, presume not God to scan;</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">The proper study of mankind is man."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>But, is not one chief object in knowing man, to acquaint
ourselves with God? In this spirit Quarles says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Man is man's A B C; there's none that can</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Read God aright, unless he first spell man."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>We may be perfectly sure that every human being, who (as
Pope continues) hangs between the sceptic and the stoic,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"In doubt to deem himself a god or beast,"</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>will never arrive at any knowledge of God whatsoever.</p>

<p>Others, again, who suppose mankind to know a great deal,
conceive all special thought which transcends the every-day
human circle, to be encompassed by a number of difficulties
exceptionally its own. If, it is said, there are angelic natures,
they must needs pity our poor attempts to survey <em>super</em>-human
or <em>extra</em>-human spheres of existence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Superior beings, when of late they saw</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">A mortal man unfold all nature's law,</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Admir'd such wisdom in an earthly shape,</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">And show'd a Newton as we show an ape."<a name="FNanchor_5_14" id="FNanchor_5_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_14" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Pope's cynicism has been lately re-echoed in various comparisons.
A death-watch has been supposed to speculate on the
final end of a clock; a timepiece on the nature of its makers.
Writers who use similitudes may be asked to remember that
if Man really possesses reason (to say nothing of an immortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
spirit), he cannot be ranged in analogy with apes, death-watches,
and timepieces. The moment brute organisms, or inorganic
constructions, are represented as <em>reasoning</em>, they cease to be
what they are&mdash;a Thing suddenly becomes a Person. If this
were all, the speech and faculties of Man would be represented
as intact, though veiled beneath some shape worthy of the
invention of a Babrias or an Æsop. But this is not all. The
monstrous shape is at once both Thing and Person, and its
thinkings in this double character are supposed to show by
their grotesque failures the absurdity of our human endeavour
to reason concerning God or Immortality.</p>

<p>To this whole kind of preoccupation the third Chapter is
addressed. There are really no special difficulties in the way
of Theism. It argues from the known to the unknown; so do
all the inductive sciences. It accepts more than it can explain;
so do we, each and all, in accepting the truth of our own individuality
and personal identity, of the world outside us, and
the mind within, which scrutinizes that changing world. The
more thoroughly questions relating to our first sources of knowledge
are debated, the more surely shall we perceive how safe
is the starting-point of Natural Theology.</p>

<p>Against Materialism, on the other hand, there may be urged
a series of difficulties properly its own, and this may be most
easily seen by placing it in contrast with pure Idealism. The
Materialistic starting-point is from an unauthorized postulate&mdash;in
common parlance, an unfounded assumption; each step it
takes is attended with a fresh need of postulation, amounting
at last to the gravest burden of improbability. And when the
materializing goal is reached we gain nothing&mdash;no treasure is
discovered&mdash;no vista opened into new realms of intellectual or
moral empire. We are only told that our supposed insight was
but a dream. We are only warned to dream no more. Materialism
has murdered insight.</p>

<p>With the argument of this Chapter there arises a very
important question, which the reader is entreated to put to
himself more than once, and bestow upon it from time to time
a pause of serious thought. In a negative form the question
runs thus: Since the difficulties supposed to bar the <em>first</em> march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of Natural Theology are in no wise peculiar to it, but attach
themselves equally to a multitude of our daily grounds of
thinking and acting, must we not, <em>if</em>, on account of such difficulties,
we deny Natural Theism, also deny those persuasions
of ordinary life? How else can we maintain our critical consistency?
Let no man henceforward be confident that there
exists an outward world of either men or things&mdash;let him not
carelessly suppose that he has even an individual mind to
speak of as his own&mdash;let all that concerns <em>other</em>ness&mdash;all that
concerns <em>self</em>ness be relegated along with the Divine Being to
the region of the Unknown and the Unknowable.</p>

<p>But we may imagine that, instead of denying these truths of
common life, many men will be hardy enough to affirm them.
If so, in accepting these they clearly accept a great deal more.
To be consistent they must accept also the reasonable beliefs
and first principles upon which reposes Theism.</p>

<p>The question thus put is therefore a dilemma or choice
between two alternatives. And there may seem to remain no
great doubt as to which alternative most practical reasoners
will accept. This kind of dilemma will recur at many several
steps of our inquiry, but having been illustrated in one instance
at considerable length, its examination on other occasions may
be safely left to the intelligence of the thoughtful reader.</p>

<p>The <em>four</em> following chapters argue for the truth of Theism on
four several and independent grounds. These arguments are
purely constructive; and each is so far apart from the other
three as to stand or fall upon its own merits. But, when each
of these four arguments has been separately examined, if admitted
either wholly or in a modified shape, their consilient and
conjoint effect must be taken into consideration<a name="FNanchor_J_15" id="FNanchor_J_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_15" class="fnanchor">[j]</a>.</p>

<p>To minimize impediments in the way of true knowledge;
and to rise into clearness;&mdash;<em>these</em> should be the hopes and aims
of us all. Life is full of foiled endeavours; but let us onward
now with the hopeful!</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS TO
CHAPTER I.</h3>


<h4><a id="A.1"></a>A.&mdash;THE RIGHT HON. W. E. GLADSTONE AND OTHERS
ON MODERN SCEPTICISM.</h4>

<p class="center"><cite>Extract from Mr. Gladstone's Address delivered at the Liverpool
Collegiate Institution, December 21st, 1872.</cite></p>

<p>"It is not now only the Christian Church, or only the Holy
Scripture, or only Christianity, which is attacked. The disposition
is boldly proclaimed to deal alike with root and branch, and to snap
utterly the ties which, under the still venerable name of Religion,
unite man with the unseen world, and lighten the struggles and the
woes of life by the hope of a better land.</p>

<p>"These things are done as the professed results and the newest
triumphs of Modern Thought and Modern Science; but I believe that
neither Science nor Thought is responsible, any more than Liberty is
responsible, for the misdeeds committed in their names. Upon the
ground of what is termed evolution, God is relieved of the labour of
creation; in the name of unchangeable laws, He is discharged from
governing the world; and His function of judgment is also dispensed
with, as justice and benevolence are held to forbid that men should
hereafter be called to strict account for actions, which under these
unchangeable laws they may have committed. But these are only
the initial stages of the process. Next we are introduced to the
doctrine of the Absolute and the Unconditioned; and under the authority
of these phrases (to which, and many other phrases, in their proper
places, I have no objection) we are instructed that we can know
nothing about God, and therefore can have no practical relations with
Him. One writer&mdash;or, as it is now termed, thinker&mdash;announces with
pleasure that he has found the means of reconciling Religion and
Science. The mode is in principle most equitable. He divides the
field of thought between them. To Science he awards all that of
which we know, or may know, something; to Religion he leaves a far
wider domain,&mdash;that of which we know, and can know, nothing.
This sounds like jest, but it is melancholy earnest; and I doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
whether any such noxious crop has been gathered in such rank
abundance from the press of England in any former year of our
literary history as in this present year of our redemption, eighteen
hundred and seventy-two." (pp. 22-3.)</p>

<p>The writer, or thinker, mentioned by Mr. Gladstone is thus
described at the end of the address, p. 33:&mdash;"My reference is to
Mr. Herbert Spencer. See his 'First Principles,' and especially
the chapter on the 'Reconciliation of Science and Religion.' It is
needless to cite particular passages. It would be difficult to mistake
its meaning, for it is written with great ability and clearness, as well
as with every indication of sincerity. Still it vividly recalls to mind
an old story of the man who, wishing to be rid of one who was in his
house, said, 'Sir, there are two sides to my house, and we will divide
them; you shall take the outside.'</p>

<p>"I believe Mr. Spencer has been described in one of our daily
journals as the first thinker of the age."</p>

<p>To some people the Premier will appear more than reasonably
disturbed by the journal's description. There is (as we have remarked)
a very advanced type of the genus journalist in England,
and its anonymous zealots are liberal in distributing titles of honour&mdash;that
is, among their friends. <i lang="la">Per contra</i>, upon authors of Mr.
Gladstone's calibre and lofty mode of thought they bestow epithets
very much the reverse of complimentary. They seem, in fact, somewhat
to resemble those critics of whom Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote,
that "though excellent fellows in their way, there are no gentlemen
in the world less sensible of any sanctity in a book, or less likely to
recognize an author's heart in it." So far, however, as Mr. Herbert
Spencer is concerned, the journal censured might observe in justification
of its approval that his system seems a good deal read by the
students of more than one school in our Premier's own University&mdash;a
proud distinction shared by Mr. Spencer with several other eminent
thinkers of the same speculative tendencies as himself.</p>

<p>The eloquent speaker next passes under brief review two other
typical books,&mdash;one by a German, the second by an Englishman.
Respecting the opinions of the former author (Strauss<a name="FNanchor_6_16" id="FNanchor_6_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_16" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>) Mr. Gladstone
writes thus (Authentic Report, p. 24):&mdash;"In his first chapter
he puts the question, 'Are we still Christians?' and, after a detailed
examination, he concludes, always speaking on behalf of Modern
Thought, that if we wish our yea to be yea, and our nay nay, if we
are to think and speak our thoughts as honourable, upright men, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
must reply that we are Christians no longer. This question and
answer, however, he observes, are insufficient. The essential and fundamental
inquiry is, whether we are or are not still to have a Religion?</p>

<p>"To this inquiry he devotes his second chapter. In this second
chapter he finds that there is no personal God; there is no future
state; the dead live in the recollection of survivors&mdash;this is enough
for them. After this he has little difficulty in answering the question
he has put. All religious worship ought to be abolished. The very
name of 'Divine Service' is an indignity to man. Therefore, in the
sense in which religion has been heretofore understood, his answer is
that we ought to have no religion any more. But proceeding, as he
always does, with commendable frankness, he admits that he ought
to fill with something the void which he has made. This he accordingly
proceeds to do. Instead of God, he offers to us the All, or
Universum. This All, or Universum, possesses, he tells us, neither
consciousness nor reason. But it presents to us order and law. He
thinks it fitted, therefore, to be the object of a new and true piety,
which he claims for his Universum, as the devout of the old style did
for their God. If any one repudiates this doctrine, to Dr. Strauss's
reason the repudiation is absurdity, and to his feelings blasphemy."<a name="FNanchor_7_17" id="FNanchor_7_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_17" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Many readers will agree with the Premier in calling these "astonishing
assertions." Many will also speak of Strauss's positions as
something worse than astonishing when they read in the Illustrative
Passages (Address, p. 34) a declaration which he holds it his duty as
well as his right to make without any kind of reserve.<a name="FNanchor_8_18" id="FNanchor_8_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_18" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>Most persons will likewise agree with the Premier's further
observation (p. 38):&mdash;"I have made a statement that these ideas are
not a mere German brood, though I fear that we owe much of their
seed to Germany, as France owed to England the seed of her great
Voltairian movement, so far as it was a movement grounded in the
region of thought."</p>

<p>In illustration of the statement that "there are many writers of
kindred sympathies in England, and some of as outspoken courage"
(Address, p. 26), Mr. Gladstone quotes four passages from Mr.
Winwood Reade's "Martyrdom of Man." The three first cited
possess a painful interest for the Natural Theologian. They are as
follows:&mdash;(1.) "When the faith in a personal God is extinguished;
when prayer and praise are no longer to be heard; when the belief
is universal that with the body dies the soul; then the false morals
of theology will no longer lead the human mind astray." (2.) "We
teach that the soul is immortal; we teach that there is a future life;
we teach that there is a Heaven in the ages far away: but not for us
single corpuscles, not for us dots of animated jelly, but for the One
of whom we are the elements, and who, though we perish, never
dies." (3.) "God is so great that He does not deign to have
personal relations with us human atoms that are called men. Those
who desire to worship their Creator must worship Him through
mankind. Such, it is plain, is the scheme of Nature." (pp. 38-9.)</p>

<p>On account of his Address and <i lang="fr">pièces justificatives</i>, Mr. Gladstone
has been already (like a prophet of old) "wounded in the house of
his friends." It may therefore be well to support his judgment by
some additional testimony. Now the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, whatever
faults may be imputed to it by its adversaries, cannot be justly
charged with harshness or discourtesy towards materializing writers.
And it so happens that both Dr. Strauss and Mr. Reade have lately
been criticised in its columns. From these notices, therefore, I shall
venture on making some extracts.</p>

<p>Strauss's "Der Alte und der Neue Glaube" was reviewed at considerable
length in the number for November 27, 1872. I quote two
passages only.</p>

<p>After an interesting introduction the reviewer proceeds thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As the title of the book indicates, the work to be effected divides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
itself into two main parts. First, it is necessary to settle the
relations to be adopted towards the old Church faith, or Christianity.
That accomplished, the outlines at least of the new views that take
its place must be sketched out. Of course, before that can be done it
must be settled whether or not there is anything to put in place
of Christianity. It is logically correct to ask, first, whether 'we'&mdash;meaning
'the thinking minority,' who have grown dissatisfied with
'the old faith'&mdash;'are still Christians' in any sense. Having answered
that question in the negative, it is in order to ask next 'whether we
have any religion,'&mdash;which cannot be answered by a simple negative
or affirmative, or without further explanations as to the nature of
religion. We must see 'how we regard the world,' or the system of
existing things; what results we are led to by modern researches as
to its origin, purpose, and destiny. Although in the light that flows
from these, Strauss maintains that the old idea of a personal God
must disappear, he finds a Divinity in the All or totality of nature,
whose forces and course exhibit purpose or design&mdash;subjectively
speaking&mdash;and order, and to which we are bound, recognizing the
wisdom that regulates them, piously to resign ourselves, seeking to
fulfil that order of which we ourselves are a part." The following
extract concludes the notice:&mdash;"We have seen that Strauss refuses
to acknowledge Christianity because on examination its assertions
appear to him incredible, and its claims therefore inadmissible. That
is the result of an examination of the nature of Christianity, in which
we have nothing new, as it is substantially a synopsis of the fuller
process of reasoning contained in 'The Life of Jesus.' But it is not
Christianity alone that must be dispensed with. In accordance with
the old declaration that miracles are impossible, the supernatural also
disappears. It is not merely relegated, as by Herbert Spencer and
Comte, to the sphere of the Unknowable; it is not recognized in any
manner whatsoever. In place of creation, we have in these pages a
process of continuous development through immense periods of time;
instead of God, as the source of law and authority and order, nature
proceeding harmoniously in an unending process; instead of individual
immortality, the conclusion that every individual fulfils his
destiny in this world. The divinities and the after life of man are,
as with Feuerbach, declared to be simply his own desires. 'What
man might be but is not, he makes his god; what he might possess
but cannot win for himself, that shall his god bestow upon him.' In
reference to the argument that man must somewhere realize all the
possibilities that are in him, and as he does not do so in this life
there must be a future one, Strauss asks whether all seeds in nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
come to maturity. Having dispensed, then, with the supernatural,
are we necessarily without any religion? We have seen that Strauss
answers in the negative, though not very confidently. The fundamental
views on human life, the existence of the world, and so forth,
are without doubt a religion, or the theoretical side of one. If in order
to a religion it be necessary to believe that the universe fulfils a
rational purpose through a rational order, we have that presented to
us. There is constant process and continuous development. There
is an ascent, as it were, of the forces of nature which perform their
mighty cycles through the ages, and a consequent descent and
vanishing away. The All remains ever the same, is at no moment
more complete than in the preceding, nor <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, but there is a
process of becoming and disappearing which goes on, or may go on
<i lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. The design or purpose of every part is being fulfilled
at every moment, for at every moment there is the richest possible
unfolding of life in the total system of things. The highest idea to
which we can attain is that of the universe.</p>

<p>"Many people were scandalized when a few years ago Mr. Mill
maintained that the idea of a God was not indispensable to a religion.
Comte's 'Religion of Humanity' was then in view. Strauss's religion,
though equally without a God, is deformed by no such crudities of
thought and feeling as Comte's. Rather is his book a representation
in brief compass of the views to which, whether we regret it or not,
the majority of educated and thinking men are in our day more and
more attracted."</p>

<p>One remarkable circumstance dwelt upon in this notice, as well
as in Mr. Gladstone's Address, is that Strauss, like Comte, finds a
substitute for the worship of a Deity&mdash;a something which both are
pleased to call a Religion. Strauss takes the theoretical, Comte the
sentimental view. According to the Frenchman, men are to worship
"Humanity" with a leaning to the female side. The un-deformed
religion of the German centres upon an Optimistic theory of the All
or Universum.<a name="FNanchor_9_19" id="FNanchor_9_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_19" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Both would seem practically to confess the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
necessity of some Religion to mankind, and the question naturally
occurs whether these <i lang="la">succedanea</i> are more wholesome and elevating
than Theism, or whether (it may be added) they are as likely to be
true after all.</p>

<p>Mr. Winwood Reade's "Martyrdom of Man" had been criticised
four days earlier (<cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, Nov. 23). As he is an English
writer, I take the liberty of making more copious extracts, but would
recommend such of my readers as have not perused the article to
bestow half an hour's steady thought upon it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Reade," writes the critic, "puts forth his book as a sort of
review, or survey, or abridgement of the general history of the human
race, and he has given to it the strange title it bears because he is of
opinion that 'the supreme and mysterious Power by whom the universe
has been created, and by whom it has been appointed to run its
course under fixed and invariable law; that awful One to whom it is
profanity to pray, of whom it is idle and irreverent to argue and debate,
of whom we should never presume to think save with humility
and awe; that Unknown God has ordained that mankind should be
elevated by misfortune, and that happiness should grow out of misery
and pain.' But, although the work is in the main historical, it is also
partly cosmological, partly physiological, and partly polemical. It
deals with the past, the present, and the future of the world as well
as of humanity....</p>

<p>"In what he has to say on the present occasion Mr. Reade lays no
claim to originality. On the contrary, he warns us that he has borrowed,
'not only facts and ideas, but phrases and even paragraphs
from other writers.' The purpose he has in view is to illustrate the
investigations and enforce the conclusions within a moderate compass
of higher and more voluminous authorities. But still there is quite
enough of his own handiwork in the volume to entitle him to be
regarded as far more than a mere compiler; and we venture to think
that many readers will find those portions of it which are the fruits of
Mr. Reade's personal experience as an African explorer, and his reflections
upon that which he has himself seen, among the most interesting
and instructive of all.</p>

<p>"In the writings of Mr. Darwin, Mr. Mill, Dr. Draper, and Mr.
Herbert Spencer, the authors to whom Mr. Reade seems to be chiefly
indebted, the assumed antagonism between the conclusions of modern
science and the premisses of popular theology is latent rather than
manifest. With them it is left as a matter of inference, and is
nowhere forced upon the attention as a matter of fact. Mr. Reade
endeavours to supply this deficiency, and he does so distinctly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
abruptly enough.... In order to build we must destroy.
Not only the Syrian superstition must be attacked, but the belief in
a 'personal God,' which engenders a slavish and oriental condition of
the mind, and the belief in a posthumous reward which engenders a
selfish and solitary condition of the heart.... What Mr.
Reade is pleased to designate 'the Syrian superstition' is still the
direct or indirect source of all the really practical sympathy existing
both between the higher and lower classes of society and the higher
and lower races of mankind. As to the belief in a personal God, the
passage we have quoted above from Mr. Reade seems to show that he
shares it, or the language he uses is mere nonsense. It would be
absurd to talk about anything except a personal God creating the
universe, appointing fixed and invariable laws, and ordaining the destiny
of mankind. And if Mr. Reade is referring merely to force
collectively or in the abstract, we cannot perceive why it 'should be
idle and irreverent to argue and debate about' it, or why 'we should
never presume to think, save with humility and awe' about it, more
than about its particular and concrete manifestations; for instance,
light, heat, or electricity. Moreover, if we admit that the universe is
in any sense the work of a supreme and mysterious Power who has
in any sense predestined an unalterable course for it to run, we cannot
understand how such a belief is fitted to remove the 'slavish and
oriental condition of mind' of which Mr. Reade complains. We
should have thought rather that the unmitigated fatalism it implies
would be far likelier to generate such an intellectual state than reliance
on providential superintendence and interposition carried to no matter
what extravagant lengths. Mr. Reade's proposition that the belief in
a posthumous reward engenders a selfish and solitary condition of the
heart appears to us likewise wide of the mark. As long as we continue
to be individual beings, our conduct will continue to be the result
of our individual feelings, present or anticipated. Practically, at all
events, the Stoic, the Sadducee, and the Christian equally will fulfil
instead of neglecting their duty&mdash;first, because they are conscious that
it is their duty, and secondly, because they know that fulfilling it will
bring them satisfaction, and that to neglect it will bring them remorse.
The only difference is that the Christian trusts that his satisfaction in
the one case, and fears that his remorse in the other case, will be
infinitely prolonged."</p>

<p>Mr. Reade's reviewer concludes his critique with a piece of wit from
Voltaire, which he views as enunciating a pretty fair summary of the
moral contained in the "Martyrdom of Man." Voltaire compares the
Creator of the world to the builder of a great house, and men to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
mice who inhabit its chinks and crannies. The Divine builder has not
enlightened us mice. This comparison has often since been repeated
in new and improved shapes by sceptical moderns, who treat a considerate
Death-watch as a typical thinker on problems of reason, such
as Design and Final Causation.</p>

<p>As author of a Lecture on Positivism in 1871, I cannot but be
gratified to perceive that Mr. Gladstone's views of Comte's character and
system are coincident with my own. (Authentic Report, pp. 25 and 36.)</p>

<p>This note began with extracts furnished by one Premier&mdash;it may not
inaptly close with quotations from the writings of another.</p>

<p>Mr. Disraeli, in his preface to the new edition of "Lothair," expresses
himself as follows (p. xv., seq.):&mdash;</p>

<p>"It cannot be denied that the aspect of the world and this country,
to those who have faith in the spiritual nature of man, is at this time
dark and distressful. They listen to doubts, and even denials, of an
active Providence; what is styled Materialism is in the ascendant.
To those who believe that an atheistical society, though it may be
polished and amiable, involves the seeds of anarchy, the prospect is
full of gloom.</p>

<p>"This disturbance in the mind of nations has been occasioned by
two causes: firstly, by the powerful assault on the divinity of the
Semitic literature by the Germans; and, secondly, by recent discoveries
of science, which are hastily supposed to be inconsistent
with our long-received convictions as to the relations between the
Creator and the created."</p>

<p>On the first cause of disturbance, Mr. Disraeli continues:&mdash;"Man
brings to the study of the oracles more learning and more criticism
than of yore: and it is well that it should be so. The documents
will yet bear a greater amount both of erudition and examination than
they have received; but the word of God is eternal, and will survive
the spheres."</p>

<p>On the second, he observes:&mdash;"Scientific, like spiritual truth, has
ever from the beginning been descending from Heaven to man. He is
a being who organically demands direct relations with his Creator, and
he would not have been so organised if his requirements could not be
satisfied. We may analyse the sun and penetrate the stars, but man
is conscious that he is made in God's own image, and in his perplexity
he will ever appeal to 'our Father which art in Heaven.'"</p>

<p>Both these sources of doubt and denial have been exemplified in
the preceding note. I might indeed have hesitated to exemplify them
so fully were it not for the considerations mentioned in my preface
to this essay.</p>

<h4><a id="B.1"></a>B.&mdash;ON CORRUPTION OF THE JUDGMENT BY MISDIRECTED
MORAL SENTIMENTS.</h4>

<p>Talfourd&mdash;then Mr. Serjeant Talfourd&mdash;thus describes what passed
in his own mind when viewing the site of Gibbon's abode at Lausanne:&mdash;"That
garden in which the Historian took his evening walk,
after writing the last lines of the work to which many years had
been devoted;&mdash;a walk which alone would have hallowed the spot,
if, alas! there had not been those intimations in the work itself of
a purpose which, tending to desecrate the world, must deprive all
associations attendant on its accomplishment of a claim to be dwelt
on as holy! How melancholy is it to feel that intellectual congratulation
which attends the serene triumph of a life of studious
toil chilled by the consciousness that the labour, the research, the
Asiatic splendour of illustration, have been devoted, in part at least,
to obtain a wicked end&mdash;not in the headlong wantonness of youth, or
the wild sportiveness of animal spirits, but urged by the deliberate,
hearted purpose of crushing the light of human hope&mdash;all that is
worth living for, and all that is worth dying for&mdash;and substituting
for them nothing but a rayless scepticism. That evening walk is an
awful thing to meditate on; the walk of a man of rare capacities,
tending to his own physical decline, among the serenities of loveliest
nature, enjoying the thought that, in the chief work of his life,
just accomplished, he had embodied a hatred to the doctrines which
teach men to love one another, to forgive injuries, and to hope for a
diviner life beyond the grave; and exulting in the conviction that
this work would survive to teach its deadly lesson to young ingenuous
students, when he should be dust. One may derive consolation from
reflecting that the style is too meretricious, and the attempt too
elaborate and too subtle, to achieve the proposed evil; and in hoping
that there were some passages in the secret history of the author's
heart, which may extenuate its melancholy error; but our personal
veneration for successful toil is destroyed in the sense of the strange
malignity which blended with its impulses, and we feel no desire
to linger over the spot where so painful a contradiction is presented
as a charm."&mdash;<cite>Vacation Rambles.</cite> Ed. 2, p. 238.</p>

<p>We may gladly give Gibbon the benefit of the doubt with which
the great judge closes. But surely most attempts to address the
mental state depicted must needs be found impotent. There is great
force in a dictum of Schelling's ("Idealismus der Wissenschaftslehre")
to the following effect&mdash;"The medium by which spirits understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
each other is not the ambient air, but the deep-stirred sympathetic
vibrations propagated by a community of spiritual freedom. When
a soul is not pervaded by this atmosphere of conscious freedom, all
inward communion with self or with another is broken,&mdash;what wonder,
then, if such a one remain unintelligible to himself and to others,
and in his fearful wilderness of spirit wearies himself by idle words,
to which no friendly echo responds, either from his own or from
another's breast?</p>

<p>"To remain unintelligible to such an one is glory and honour
before God and man. <i lang="la">Barbarus huic ego sim, nec tali intelligar ulli.</i>
This," concludes Schelling, "is a wish and prayer from which no
man can keep himself."&mdash;<cite>Sämmtliche Werke</cite>, I. 443.</p>


<h4><a id="C.1"></a>C.&mdash;ON SPECIAL PLEADING IN HISTORY AND MORALS.</h4>

<p>A few emphatic sentences from Lord Macaulay's strictures on
historical special pleading will repay perusal:&mdash;"This species of misrepresentation
abounds in the most valuable works of modern historians.
Herodotus tells his story like a slovenly witness, who, heated
by partialities and prejudices, unacquainted with the established rules
of evidence, and uninstructed as to the obligations of his oath, confounds
what he imagines with what he has seen and heard, and
brings out facts, reports, conjectures, and fancies in one mass. Hume
is an accomplished advocate. Without positively asserting much more
than he can prove, he gives prominence to all the circumstances
which support his case; he glides lightly over those which are unfavourable
to it; his own witnesses are applauded and encouraged;
the statements which seem to throw discredit on them are controverted;
the contradictions into which they fall are explained away;
a clear and connected abstract of their evidence is given. Everything
that is offered on the other side is scrutinised with the utmost
severity; every suspicious circumstance is a ground for comment and
invective; what cannot be denied is extenuated, or passed by without
notice; concessions even are sometimes made; but this insidious
candour only increases the effect of the vast mass of sophistry.</p>

<p>"We have mentioned Hume as the ablest and most popular writer
of his class; but the charge which we have brought against him is
one to which all our most distinguished historians are in some degree
obnoxious. Gibbon, in particular, deserves very severe censure."&mdash;<cite>Macaulay's
Miscellaneous Writings&mdash;History.</cite></p>

<p>The reader may very advantageously carry along with him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
above quoted just remarks, if he has occasion to travel into Hume's
sceptical writings. Respecting these, where every feature of the
author's character appears with intensified distinctness of expression,
it is not too much to say that their influence, which had suffered
suspended animation,<a name="FNanchor_10_20" id="FNanchor_10_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_20" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> is now felt in almost every cultivated circle
in Europe. Checked for a time under the empire of Kant and his
successors, it has been revived by the German Darwinists (so-called),
who are bent on evolving all that can be got from the theory of
Evolution. Comte speaks of Hume as his own master&mdash;an intellectual
debt all the more readily acknowledged, because Hume's treatment of
most subjects leans towards the French, rather than the Teutonic,
side of English speculation. The master's influence over numbers who,
without being Comte's disciples, are addicted to thinking Positively
upon questions connected with Mind and Morality, was never greater
than at present.</p>

<p>Here, therefore, the disciplined inquirer will obtain a prolific field
of discovery, if he wishes to convince himself how little originality
pervades the set of opinions just now in fashion.</p>

<p>But the student of Hume ought surely to be a disciplined inquirer.
Many senior residents at our Universities will, therefore, join me
in regretting that his sceptical treatises should be so commonly found
in the hands of very young men. So far as such readers are concerned,
it does not much signify whether Hume's fallacies are due
to onesidedness of intellect or (as has been said by a critic, once
himself a doubter) whether he was influenced "by vanity, appetite,
and the ambition of forming a sect of <i>arguescents</i>." An opinion
scarcely libellous, considering what Hume has said respecting the
validity of his own paradoxes. However this may appear, the fallacies
remain fallacies, and are less easy of detection than they would have
been were their author a systematic thinker, instead of a philosophical
<em>dilletante</em>. Under any circumstances, it is not every aspirant
to the "Round Table" for whom the quest after secret spells is fitted.
The youthful knight has his own ward to keep, and needs help&mdash;not
hindrance, much less betrayal&mdash;inasmuch as:&mdash;</p>

<h4><a id="D.1"></a>D.&mdash;ON THE METHOD EMPLOYED IN THIS ESSAY.</h4>

<p>The advantages which ensue from this mode of "ranging round
each topic" are well described by the late Sir B. Brodie (Psychological
Inquiries, 1st series, p. 18). "Our minds are so constructed that we
can keep the attention fixed on a particular object until we have, as it
were, looked all around it; and the mind that possesses this faculty
in the greatest degree of perfection will take cognisance of relations
of which another mind has no perception. It is this, much more than
any difference in the abstract power of reasoning, which constitutes
the vast difference which exists between the minds of different individuals;
which distinguishes the far-sighted statesman from the
shallow politician; the sagacious and accomplished general from the
mere disciplinarian. Such also is the history, not only of the poetic
genius, but also of the genius of discovery in science. 'I keep the
subject,' said Sir Isaac Newton, 'constantly before me, and wait until
the first dawnings open by little and little into a full light.' It was
thus that, after long meditation, he was led to the invention of fluxions,
and to the anticipation of the modern discovery of the combustibility
of the diamond. It was thus that Harvey discovered the circulation
of the blood; and that those views were suggested to Davy, which
are propounded in the Bakerian lecture of 1806, and which laid the
foundation of that grand series of experimental researches which terminated
in the decomposition of the earths and alkalies."</p>

<p>Dr. Tyndall also considers the case of Newton ("Fragments of
Science," p. 60). "Newton pondered all these things. He had a
great power of pondering. He could look into the darkest subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
until it became entirely luminous. How this light arises we cannot
explain; but, as a matter of fact, it does arise." Dr. Tyndall had
before remarked on the question thus suggested, that "There is much
in this process of pondering and its results which it is impossible to
analyse. It is by a kind of inspiration that we rise from the wise and
sedulous contemplation of facts to the principles on which they
depend. The mind is, as it were, a photographic plate, which is
gradually cleansed by the effort to think rightly, and which when so
cleansed, and not before, receives impressions from the light of truth.
This passage from facts to principles is called induction, which in its
highest form is inspiration; but, to make it sure, the inward sight
must be shown to be in accordance with outward fact. To prove or
disprove the induction, we must resort to deduction and experiment."&mdash;Ibid,
p. 57-8.</p>

<p>This last remark concerns the process of verification which the
accomplished writer discusses through several subsequent pages.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a passing observation of Dr. Tyndall's that "this
power of pondering facts is one with which the ancients could be but
imperfectly acquainted," some readers will be struck by the thought
that it forms the nearest approach which can be made by any
inductive discoverer to the old philosophical method of Dialectic.
Janet says, in a volume to which those who have not encountered it
will thank me for introducing them, "La dialectique logique dans
Platon est parfaitement conforme aux lois de la raison. Elle ne sert
qu'à réfuter les idées fausses, ou à éclaircir les idées données antérieurement
par une sorte de synthèse, qui, suivant les uns, n'est que le
progrès de la généralisation, et, selon nous, est le progrès de l'intuition."
(Études sur la Dialectique dans Platon et dans Hegel, p. 393.)
For a more complete appreciation of what is here stated in few words,
the student should peruse pp. 244, seq. The account given by Janet
appears in some measure to coincide with Dr. Tyndall's idea, though
perhaps the word "Intuition" might be more entirely approved by
Schelling or Coleridge than by any Physicist.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, Dr. Tyndall's outline of the Inductive process in
its highest form is evidently one which describes the prerogative of
Genius&mdash;the exercise of Imagination as distinguished from Fancy&mdash;the
child, that is, of Reason, rather than a stray bantling of sportive
wit.</p>

<p>To bring his general conception within the grasp of every-day
workers, and describe a procedure which may be adopted as a kind of
practical rule or maxim, let us look at this subject in the following
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Suppose we take the example of a great idea; that, for instance, of
the constitution of Great Britain, or any other nation which subsists
in tolerable freedom from revolutionary change. There are clearly
two elements involved&mdash;one, Permanence; the other, Progress.
These, in the actual working constitution, form its factors, or moments
(as they may be better termed); and in the idea or mental representation
of the same, we may liken them to complementary colours in the
spectrum, which appear separately contrasted in tint, but blend together
in a wave of white light. Now, our analysing faculty of mind is, in
point of fact, our intellectual prism. It separates each bright and
strong idea into elements so antagonistic as to be apparently incompatible.
Like clear yellow and shadowy violet, one component seems
excellent in beauty, another its foil or opposite. To one class of
minds truth consists in Permanence, and Progress is a note of evil
omen. Of another class the contradictory is true. The real statesman
alone knows that their blending is a question of measure and degree,
of human affairs,&mdash;time, circumstance, and opportunity.</p>

<p>We may ask with reason what gain accrues to the statesman by
looking at his country's constitution from this point of sight? Evidently
a good deal. He will soon discern that practically it cannot
exist in vigour if either factor be eliminated. Each is given in the
analysis of his prolific idea, and, however great may seem the apparent
incompatibility, both must be capable of co-existence and correlation.
Now, there could be no synthesis if, on the one hand, Progress
did not imply a something which remains identical and in unity
with itself, while it flourishes and grows;&mdash;or, on the other hand, if
Permanence were not safest, when its strength is manifested by its
vital increase. Consequently, to grow is to continue essentially the
same;&mdash;to be permanent is to live and bear fresh fruit every passing
year.</p>

<p>A precisely similar advantage accrues to the Ethical Philosopher from
a process of the like description. He considers (it may be) the concrete
idea of moral activity. Obviously, there must be found in it an
unfettered power of choice, and a conformity to the rule of moral
law. Submitted to the analytic prism, the two elements come out at
opposite poles in very decided contrast. At the pole of necessary conformity
we find what looks like Determinism;&mdash;at the pole of choice
appears its irreconcilable antagonist, a sense of Responsibility, logically
unexplained, but inalienable from our moral nature. And our
Ethical inquirer finds the only possible synthesis of his two contrasted
moments of morality in the deep truth that each righteous man is a
Law unto himself. And hence it is, that the righteous shines out over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the lower world of mechanical arrangement&mdash;a faint, it may be, but still
a visible image of the God who made him what he is.<a name="FNanchor_11_21" id="FNanchor_11_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_21" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>By the same process of analysis and reconstruction the Natural
Theologian arrives (as may be shown) at a synthesis of Faith and
Reason. Yet these two are antagonistic in the eyes both of the
sceptic and the superstitious. <i lang="fr">Les extrêmes se touchent</i>, and by
both extremes faith is relegated to the region of sentimental æsthetics.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p>Reason, say both, is Faith's natural enemy; and must fail to yield any
expectation of future happiness in the presence of a righteous God,
together with its long train of present hopes and fears. Our plain
answer is that the true synthesis of Natural Theism lies in the chief
primary fact of our human nature&mdash;the undeniable existence of its
Reasonable Beliefs. They originate deep down, and we may affirm
respecting the birth of each and all, as Dr. Tyndall affirms of the
inward vision which dawns upon the philosophic mind when photographically
cleansed by its own efforts to think rightly,&mdash;"how this
light arises we cannot explain, but as a matter of fact it does arise."
In its degree it may be (to use Dr. Tyndall's word) "a kind of
inspiration." And what endowment has a higher claim to such a
representative kinship?&mdash;what nobler gift can be conceived from God
to man than a Belief of Reason? Dr. Tyndall's further requirement
that "the inward sight must be shown to be in accordance with the
outward fact," a Natural Theologian may hope to meet by a sufficient
verification. He may meet it in the case of this particular Belief by
showing, as we shall try to show, our actual human experience of its
working and its worth.</p>

<p>We might pursue similar examples through the regions of Discovery
and Production, but the three instances already adduced may fairly
suffice. It is, perhaps, more interesting to observe the real gains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
which accrue from pondering over an idea in the manner exemplified.
How much political <em>charlatanerie</em> is at once disposed of when men
distinctly acknowledge that two reputed incompatibilities, however
useful as war-cries, are essentially conjoint elements in all truly
statesmanlike action: what countless angry controversies die in the
moral principle that each righteous man is a Law unto himself! And
not only to Natural Theology, but to other parts of knowledge, it is of
the greatest utility to perceive with equal distinctness that Reason has
its beliefs as well as Unreason; and that when we accept reasonable
beliefs as the basis of scientific investigation, we affirm their value for
the conduct and government of life. The true amount of that value
as a mainspring of our hopeful activities is estimated on another
page. Meantime, we may remark from the three examples above
discussed, how regularly an idea of Reason, analysed into its complementary
factors, resumes a concrete form when we employ it as a
maxim of practical life. The politician who separates progress from
stability is really preparing his country for revolution. The man on
whose heart the law is not written (like the necessity laid upon St.
Paul<a name="FNanchor_12_22" id="FNanchor_12_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_22" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>) is as yet imperfectly righteous. And so too, if in our Beliefs
we lose sight of the gift that makes us human, we are likely to ring
the changes between superstition, atheism, and effeminate sentimentality.</p>

<p>When, from results, we pass to the easiest method for attaining
them, there seems but little to add to the extracts with which this
note commenced. And if the object be clearly defined, the labour
of the mental workshop need not be a severe discouragement. It is
true that no man can take his Thought&mdash;the offspring of his inward
Light&mdash;pull it to pieces, and reconstruct it, as he would deal with a
thing of brass or iron. But every earnest ponderer may keep his
prolific idea steadily in view, and hold conversations with himself
respecting it. This is the well-known method by which Aristotle
virtually obtains his conclusions before he finally proceeds to deduce
them. From the same conception of Method, real thinking appears
to Plato as a Dialogue without speech. And, doubtless, actual discussion
between two or more living men would be the surest way of
arriving at the goal of insight, provided those most uncommon of all
endowments, common sense and common honesty, could be assured
to the dialecticians.<a name="FNanchor_13_23" id="FNanchor_13_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_23" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus much, then, may serve as an illustration of the task we are
attempting, and of the means by which we hope to accomplish it.
If achieved, it will form a contribution to the great work thus
characterised by the Rector of Lincoln College from the University
pulpit, as reported in the <cite>Oxford Undergraduates' Journal</cite> for
October 26, 1871: "The Natural Theology of the last century is no
longer found to be satisfactory in presence of the geological and
biological sciences as they now stand. The answer that the sciences
are wrong and the theologians are right does not admit of being
discussed or refuted, for it is the answer of ignorance. The answer
of the Catholic Church, which is to take refuge in its own authority,
can only be practically tendered where there is an infallible living
authority, as in the chair of S. Peter. It seems to be the business
of the English Church especially&mdash;a Church which has never yet
broken with reason or proscribed education&mdash;to fairly face these
questions, to resume the Natural Theology of the past age, and to
re-establish the synthesis of Science and Faith."</p>


<h4><a id="E.1"></a>E.&mdash;ON THE EFFECT OF CONSILIENT PROOFS.</h4>

<p>The expressive word "<em>Consilience</em>" has been adopted on the
authority of Dr. Whewell and Professor Pritchard, both of whom
employ it in preference to the commoner expression <em>convergence</em>.
Upon the force of consilient proofs, Dr. Whewell writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The cases in which inductions from classes of facts altogether
different have <em>jumped together</em>, belong only to the best established
theories which the history of science contains. And as I shall have
occasion to refer to this peculiar feature in their evidence, I will take
the liberty of describing it by a particular phrase, and will term it
the <em>Consilience of Inductions</em>.</p>

<p>"It is exemplified principally in some of the greatest discoveries.
Thus it was found by Newton that the doctrine of the attraction of
the sun varying according to the inverse square of the distance,
which explained Kepler's <em>Third Law</em> of the proportionality of the
cubes of the distances to the squares of the periodic times of the
planets, explained also his <em>First</em> and <em>Second Laws</em> of the elliptical
motion of each planet; although no connexion of these laws had been
visible before. Again, it appeared that the force of universal gravitation,
which had been inferred from the <em>perturbations</em> of the moon and
planets by the sun and by each other, also accounted for the fact,
apparently altogether dissimilar and remote, of the <em>precession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
equinoxes</em>. Here was a most striking and surprising coincidence,
which gave to the theory a stamp of truth beyond the power of
ingenuity to counterfeit....</p>

<p> ... The theory of universal gravitation, and of the undulatory
theory of light, are indeed full of examples of this consilience of
inductions. With regard to the latter, it has been justly asserted by
Herschel, that the history of the undulatory theory was a succession
of <i>felicities</i>. And it is precisely the unexpected coincidences of results
drawn from distant parts of the subject which are properly thus
described." ("Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences," B. XI., chap.
v., s. 3.)</p>

<p>And again, "It is true, the explanation of one set of facts may be
of the same nature as the explanation of the other class; but then,
that the cause explains <em>both</em> classes, gives it a very different claim
upon our attention and assent from that which it would have if it
explained one class only. The very circumstance that the two
explanations coincide, is a most weighty presumption in their favour.
It is the testimony of two witnesses in behalf of the hypothesis; and
in proportion as these two witnesses are separate and independent,
the conviction produced by their agreement is more and more complete.
When the explanation of two kinds of phenomena, distinct,
and not apparently connected, leads us to the same cause, such a
coincidence does give a reality to the cause, which it has not while it
merely accounts for those appearances which suggested the supposition.
This coincidence of propositions inferred from separate classes
of facts, is exactly what we noticed in the last book, as one of the
most decisive characteristics of a true theory, under the name of
<em>Consilience of Inductions</em>.</p>

<p>"That Newton's first rule of philosophizing, so understood,
authorizes the inferences which he himself made, is really the ground
on which they are so firmly believed by philosophers. Thus, when the
doctrine of a gravity varying inversely as the square of the distance
from the body, accounted at the same time for the relations of
times and distances in the planetary orbits and for the amount of the
moon's deflection from the tangent of her orbit, such a doctrine
became most convincing: or, again, when the doctrine of the
universal gravitation of all parts of matter, which explained so
admirably the inequalities of the moon's motions, also gave a satisfactory
account of a phenomenon utterly different&mdash;the precession of
the equinoxes. And of the same kind is the evidence in favour of the
undulatory theory of light, when the assumption of the length of an
undulation, to which we are led by the colours of thin plates, is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to be identical with that length which explains the phenomena of
diffraction; or when the hypothesis of transverse vibrations, suggested
by the facts of polarization, explains also the laws of double refraction.
When such a convergence of two trains of induction points to
the same spot, we can no longer suspect that we are wrong. Such
an accumulation of proof really persuades us that we have to do with
a <i lang="la">vera causa</i>. And if this kind of proof be multiplied,&mdash;if we again
find other facts of a sort uncontemplated in framing our hypothesis,
but yet clearly accounted for when we have adopted the supposition,&mdash;we
are still further confirmed in our belief, and by such accumulation
of proof we may be so far satisfied as to believe without
conceiving it possible to doubt. In this case, when the validity of
the opinion adopted by us has been repeatedly confirmed by its
sufficiency in unforeseen cases, so that all doubt is removed and
forgotten, the theoretical cause takes its place among the realities of
the world, and becomes <em>a true cause</em>." (Ibid. B. XII., chap. xiii.,
art. 10.)</p>

<p>The reader of this Essay will be pleased to remark as he proceeds
that its argument is made up of a diversity of proofs (very many
among them being inductive), and that they all lend each other mutual
support and become consilient at last.</p>

<p class="center"><big>CHAPTER II</big>.</p>


<p class="center">PHILOSOPHY OF DESIGN.</p>

<p>The argument from Design in Nature has been made familiar
to most readers in Natural Theology by Paley's well-known
book. It is probable that no argument has ever been more
praised, and at the same time more strongly controverted.
Our business lies, of course, with the controversy; and we
must say a few words on our present mode of dealing with it.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more useless than to repeat illustrative
examples of Design already thrice told by an endless variety
of treatises. Of so wide a subject everything may be quoted
as an illustration, from a pebble to a world, if only the
principle illustrated&mdash;the pivot on which the argument turns&mdash;be
understood and admitted. In modern times, this turning-point
is precisely the centre of the dispute. Untrained minds
misapprehend the meaning of the word Design, and are
further still from apprehending the real force of argument
from analogy. And when these subjects come to be discussed
by skilled writers, various questions are always raised which
generally issue in irreconcilable differences of opinion.</p>

<p>Our plan here will be to take the argument in its best-known
shape, and examine it from the points of view occupied
by several classes of objectors, beginning, as is reasonable,
with the most popular difficulties and misapprehensions. It
does not seem necessary to load the page with references to
controversialists of the ordinary sort, particularly as we
endeavour to look at the whole question through their eyes.</p>

<p>Respecting the more philosophic questions it is necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
observe, that the Evolution-theory will not form a topic of the
present chapter. It is excluded for two reasons. One, that
we are now trying to put a value on the argument from Design
<i lang ="la">per se</i>, and not to compare it with rival theories. The other
reason springs from the subject of Evolution itself&mdash;it is too
extensive to be thus briefly treated&mdash;and the sum of this Essay
must be taken together as furnishing a counter statement to
the manner in which it has been employed by certain of its
ardent advocates.<a name="FNanchor_14_24" id="FNanchor_14_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_24" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
</p>
<p>We hope for a further advantage from the method proposed.
The cause of truth ought to gain from being looked at on
more than one side; and, whatever be the worth and true
effect of reasoning from Design, we may expect by this method
to display it adequately.
</p>
<p>The word itself, like all figurative terms&mdash;or words used in
a secondary sense&mdash;is by no means free from ambiguity. It
has, in common parlance, several shades of signification.
Design being the centre of Paley's argument, and containing
the one idea which gives force to all the rest: his first object
was to fix the sense in which he employed it. He did so by
using an illustration.
</p>
<p>To explain by comparison is always a popular resource,
some serious drawbacks notwithstanding. Almost every one
prefers that an author should use a sparkling similitude
which tells a great deal, rather than write what looks like a
grammar and dictionary of his science. Analysis and induction
require thought on the part of him who employs them&mdash;thought
also on the part of a reader determined to understand
what he reads. Paley saw all this thoroughly, and
at the beginning of his book employed the now celebrated
comparison taken from a watchmaker and a watch. His
judgment received support from the popularity he enjoyed,
and from the way in which everybody borrowed his
illustration.<a name="FNanchor_15_25" id="FNanchor_15_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_25" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet Paley's deference to the popular understanding gave
rise to the first general misapprehension of his treatise. He
sets out from a kind of surprise&mdash;the surprise his readers
would feel at finding a watch upon a heath. Now this feeling
was immediately alleged as a conclusive objection against
Paley's comparison, and as a ground for distrusting the whole
argument founded upon it. The world, it was said, cannot be
likened to a watch, nor yet to any other sort of mechanism.
Between things natural, and the things which men make, the
difference is not a mere contrast of perfection with imperfection.
The real reason why we are surprised to see Paley's
watch lying on a moor&mdash;and not at all surprised to see Paley's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
stone lying beside it&mdash;springs from this very difference. And
though the history of a stone, common, coarse, and worthless,
is really more wonderful than the history of any watch, and
though the stone has an infinitely longer pedigree, we should
never speak or think of it in the same way. We feel that the
objects are dissimilar, and our surprise testifies the fact. A
heath is given up to nature, a watchmaker's shop to art. The
watch is out of place among stones, the stone among watches.
The idea raised at the outset, therefore, is that Art and Nature
would seem to be thoroughly unlike.</p>

<p>At a first view of the subject, these remarks appear open to
one obvious rejoinder. The sort of surprised feeling which
Paley describes, is not in itself a proof of real unlikeness. A
weed is a plant out of place; we do not expect thriving crops
of cabbage or teazle in a carefully kept rose-garden, nor gooseberry
bushes amongst azaleas. The proudest flower that
blossoms is a weed in a vineyard, in a plot of opium-poppies,
or mixed with other herbs medicinal. So, too, a rough diamond
would not be out of place in a watchmaker's shop; but if we saw
a stone of no selling value inside a case of watches we should
certainly experience some surprise. And the feeling would
remain even though we were quite unable to explain how the
poor pebble differed chemically from the priceless gem. We
know that the latter would appear to a jeweller's customers
like a rose among flowers, but the former worthless as a weed.
The jeweller would consider it a trespasser fit only to be
turned out of doors.</p>

<p>But does this rejoinder satisfactorily dispose of the difficulty?
Is not the true reason why we might observe with
some wonder a watch lying upon a moor resolvable into the
fact of our knowing its use and being quite sure that some one
had dropped it there?<a name="FNanchor_K_26" id="FNanchor_K_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_26" class="fnanchor">[k]</a> A savage might not feel in the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
surprised, unless, indeed, he happened to suppose that the
watch was a kind of animal he had never seen before, and took
notice of the singular sound it made. In this event he would
probably break it to pieces without discovering the purpose or
mode of its contrivance.</p>

<p>Throughout all disputatious matter, a thought on one side
leads to a thought upon the other&mdash;at least, amongst tolerably
fair people. The idea which we have just imagined our savage
to entertain respecting a watch suggests a further question.
What effect ought in reason to be produced upon cultured
minds by the contemplation of some unknown or half-comprehended
phenomenon?&mdash;a question this, closely bearing upon
the whole subject under discussion. Now surely it is from intelligent
wonder&mdash;a contrast of the unknown with what we
already know&mdash;a feeling of mystery to be solved by us, that
inquiry and science perpetually spring. A fossil-shell, the
former habitation of a marine animal, found upon some
mountain top, presents a contrast and a mystery of this kind.
Moreover, the highest triumph of inquiring science is the
discovery, not of difference anywhere, but rather of resemblances
in objects apparently diverse. An uninquiring
mind will never perceive any common attribute, either ideal
or structural, between a stone and a watch.</p>

<p>But did Paley himself perceive any such community of
attribute? So far does he appear from the perception that
he speaks of the stone as an "unorganised, unmechanised
substance, without mark or indication of contrivance," and
adds, "It might be difficult to show that such substance could
not have existed from eternity." Paley's day was meagre in
natural science, and Paley was as meagrely acquainted with its
results as he was with metaphysical philosophy. Few people,
however, even now-a-days, know enough of the laws which
govern inorganic products to find their investigation a slight
or easy task. For a purpose of comparison with any human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
work or mechanism, most inquirers will prefer having recourse
with Paley to the world of organisation. The flower and
fructification of a plant or shrub growing on the heath beside
Paley's watch, though carelessly passed over a thousand times,
and exciting no surprise from anything unusual in its <em>habitat</em>,
will, when observed, raise the most sincere admiration. And
the same may be said of the bony skeleton of the lizard<a name="FNanchor_16_27" id="FNanchor_16_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_27" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
racing round plant and shrub, the forehand of the mole which
burrows beneath them, and the wing of the bat circling
nightly in upper air.</p>

<p>Take, then, replies the objector, an organism, vegetable or
animal, whichever you or Paley may prefer. The difficulty
formerly urged at once recurs, slightly altered in shape, but
with augmented point and force. Your organisms are not put
together like the parts of a watch (<i lang="la">undique collatis membris</i>)&mdash;brass
from this place, steel from that, and so on, with china
dial-plate, covering-glass, and gold case. All these things
were apart in nature, they were severally chosen, manipulated,
and brought together. What we see is a successful union of
materials possessing inherent adaptation to definite purposes&mdash;such
as the freedom of brass from rust, or the superior elasticity
of steel, qualities indicating the skill and workmanlike knowledge
of some human artificer, and showing by their utilization
the truth of what was before asserted. Watches and worlds,
the products of Art and of Nature, are obviously and thoroughly
unlike.</p>

<p>By way of answer, it might be observed that in organization
we do really see very distinct constituents combined. In a
plant, for instance, there is the combination of a growing
point, a humus or pabulum that feeds it, and the stimuli, air,
water, light, and all the "skiey influences" by which its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
passive vitality is excited and sustained. We see plant life,
by reason of these concurrent adaptations, swelling into leaf,
stem, bud, corolla, and fruit, throughout all the brighter tribes
of vegetable beauty that bloom apparent to the unassisted eye.
And the like holds true respecting animals, but with increased
variety and complication of conditions, made necessary by
their higher mode of existence. The marvels of their many
powers, habits, and perfections of form and movement are
great, but greater still the vast multitude of ministering aids
put in requisition to ensure their earliest appearance and after
continuance in life and enjoyment. When we contemplate
microscopic Nature, a like sweep of combination is again evident
to the skilful naturalist, and excites his constant wonder,
especially when observed in connection with the exquisite
finish of minute creatures and their infinitesimal parts, both
alike unperceived by our ordinary human senses. And a
similar idea of invisible, and perhaps almost incomprehensible,
harmony might be raised by a consideration of the elements,
metallic and non-metallic, brought together in numberless
inorganic productions, as well as of the forces which bind
them in hard cohesion, and give them such properties as
we may discover in the commonest block of granite. And
what if we could extend our field of view to a world&mdash;to the
universe?</p>

<p>The answer suggested by this last paragraph has its value,
and the principle involved in it will occur for our scrutiny
further on. But at present this train of thought, if pursued,
might be likened to the weed we spoke of,&mdash;it would not be
altogether in place here. The truth is that the whole objection
thus parried appears more out of place still, and is therefore
itself not a flower, but a weed of popular rhetoric. And the
reason of its irrelevancy is plain. Paley's argument does not
really turn upon the similitude of any two objects of simple
apprehension, but upon an analogical comparison; the discovery,
that is, of the likeness between two ratios, a process
known in common life under the name of Proportion. Hence
it is from the illative force of analogy that this topic of Design
derives its value. The analogy does, in fact, serve a double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
purpose,&mdash;- <em>first</em> to explain, and <em>secondly</em> to prove. We had
better look at it from both points of view.</p>

<p>The easiest method for making an <em>illustrative</em> analogy
intelligible is to state it in old-fashioned style as a rule of three
sum; the fourth term being the conclusion which completes it.
"As a watch is to the watchmaker, so is creation, (exemplified
by such and such a specimen,) to its Creator." That is to say,
there exists some ratio or relation connecting the watch and
the watchmaker, which exists also between the world and its
Creator.</p>

<p>To see its <em>illative</em> force used as an argument, we need only
alter the position of the four terms, and state our proportion as
is more usual in modern day. "As the watch is to such and
such specimens of creation, so is the watchmaker to the Author
of any and all of these things."</p>

<p>In the <em>first</em> statement Paley's similitude is displayed in full
as an asserted illustration of Design. The watch is a thing
contrived&mdash;that is, a design realized, and the maker is its
contriver. Just so, is the world a Design realized by its
Creator. And it appears plainly implied in the assertion, that
even as the little watch shows the limited power and intelligence
of its maker, so the vast and unfathomable universe
illustrates the infinite power and wisdom of its incomprehensible
Author.</p>

<p>The <em>second</em> mode of statement displays the force of Paley's
analogy viewed as a chain of reasoning. The watch is <em>not like</em>
the world, but there is something in common between them,
and this something it is Paley's purpose, and the purpose of
his various continuators, to show at the greatest convenient
length. Now such community of character must be sufficient
to establish a further community still. When we see a watch
we are sure it had a designer,&mdash;the watchmaker; and here,
again, Paley means to argue that from every example of contrivance
which we can adduce and examine, the same inference
ensues, and always must ensue. Therefore (he concludes) from
the immeasurable designed world we infer the world's omnipotent
Designer.</p>

<p>The chief Divine attributes (as, for example, omnipotence)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
are dwelt upon by Paley towards the close of his treatise. But
it seems well to insert the adjective at once. Most thinking
persons admit that whoever believes in a Creator may find
from the physical Cosmos and its</p>

<p class="center">"Mysterious worlds untravelled by the sun,"</p>


<p>ample reason for justifying the noblest of such adjectives.
They generally go further, and allow that any Theist finds in
these endless marvels a full confirmation of his faith&mdash;there
is, as Coleridge says, a whole universe at hand to ratify the
decision. But what many educated people who concede thus
much disallow, is the sufficient witness of Design standing
by itself to prove what it may fairly corroborate or even
extend. To illustrate, confirm, or widen what is already
held a truth is one thing; to serve as its sole sufficient witness
is another. This conclusiveness some deny, and more
scruple to affirm. And one of the drawbacks in arguing
from analogy seems to be, that all except the most philosophically
trained minds experience a sort of hesitation in estimating
its force&mdash;a hesitation which they are at a loss to define in
words. Consequently, the attack upon its adequacy is always
difficult to answer; so many various shades of negation must
be classed together for brevity's sake, and met by one or two
general lines of defence. The safest way, probably, is to make
the negative classes as wide as possible, and to put the scientific
doubts in their most fatal form of expression. And
it appears hard to imagine anything really destructive of
evidence which may not be brought under one of the two
following heads. There may be, first, a failure of evidence
when it is not strong enough in its facts and circumstances to
justify the conclusion drawn&mdash;when, in short, it proves too
little. Secondly, it is worthless, if its acceptance so damages
the position occupied by those who employ it, that their purpose
is thereby destroyed, their <i lang="la">locus standi</i> demolished&mdash;in
other words, they have proved too much.</p>

<p>May we not, then, presume it impossible to bring worse
charges against any argument than whatever can be urged in
support of these two accusations? And we will <em>first</em> put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
well-known analogy on its trial for proving too much, because
it is from anxiety to avoid this charge that most analogical
reasoners are apt to risk proving too little.</p>

<p>Admit, say Paley's most decided antagonists, the relevancy
of an argument from human art. It must be taken to show
the Creator of the Universe as Theists conceive and acknowledge
Him. Let us at once ask in what light He is thereby
represented? Is it not, so to speak, as a supreme Anthropomorphic<a name="FNanchor_L_28" id="FNanchor_L_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_28" class="fnanchor">[l]</a>
Craftsman sketching a vast plan or design, and
moulding the materials necessary for its realization? We
begin with the remark that His work&mdash;the world&mdash;must show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
some traces of that plastic process and the hand of its Moulder.
The requirement seems just and reasonable, and is commonly
answered by an appeal to what have been termed the records
of creation, the structure of the heavens, and the structure of
the earth. Thus, for example, we are referred to Geology and
Palæontology, and are led from age to age, and type to type.
In passing from one formation to another we seem (as Goethe
said) to catch Nature in the fact. At all events the plastic
process is everywhere traceable, and to its evidences the Theist
points with triumph.</p>

<p>But no intelligent objector can stop here. He will next
inquire what on theistic principles was the origin of this
material substance so constantly undergoing transformation.
Most sceptical thinkers put the inquiry in a trenchant manner;
they not only demand to be answered, but they prescribe
beforehand the sort of answer to be returned. It is useless,
they tell us, to speak of archetypes existing in the Divine mind,
and to illustrate them by the creative thought of musician
or sculptor, of painter or of poet. The hard, coarse world
must be looked at as it is: an actual material habitation for
sorrowing and sinful human creatures; its physical conditions,
imperfect in that respect, unhappily corresponding too well
with the low moralities of its tenants.
</p>
<p>Now, they say, if we examine Paley's common-sense analogy
no one can at all doubt what answer is suggested there. The
steel of the watch-spring, the brass of the wheel-work, and
other materials for all the curious mechanical contrivances
required, were taken into account by the watch-designer when
he formed his design. Had it been otherwise he could not
have calculated on finding the necessary strength, elasticity,
resistance to rust, and other properties on which Paley dwells
so distinctly. In like manner, it has been said by some
physical science Christians since Paley's time: "Let matter and
its primary properties be presupposed, and the argument from
Design is easy." True, but it seems quite as easy to suppose
the world itself eternal. And we know that this supposition
was adopted by pagan philosophers, to whom it appeared the
easiest of all beliefs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
</p>
<p>But other philosophic pagans, holding clearly that the
world had a beginning, conceived its First Cause to be like
Paley's Designer&mdash;analogous to an earthly workman. They
carried out the analogy thoroughly&mdash;more thoroughly than
modern writers, and believed both Artificer and the matter
from which He shaped the visible universe, self-subsistent,
indestructible, and co-eternal.</p>

<p>In this eternity of matter and its native inflexibilities, these
great heathen thinkers found an apology for what they considered
the failure of creative power&mdash;misshapen things, monstrosities,
and imperfections. The Creator never desired them,
but His will was thwarted by the material He worked in.
Against this dualism the early Fathers protested. Will the
modern Theist (his assailants ask) deny himself, and affirm
two independent and self-existent principles; or will he deny
the parallelism asserted in Paley's analogy? Can he conscientiously
believe that its issue is a worthy representation of
the Divine and omnipotent Creator? If not, it has failed by
proving too much<a name="FNanchor_M_29" id="FNanchor_M_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_29" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a><br /><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
raised. Who can help seeing that several of them lie equally
against all rational theories which have ever been suggested
to account for the origin of that sorrow and evil which we
see and acknowledge everywhere? And does not the same
remark apply to every attempt at solving the antithesis of
mind and matter? Some thoughtful men have believed that
they could see their way to a solution; others believe it altogether
above human reason, and point with a kind of triumph
to the failures of philosophy. However this may be, the
mournful moral enigma,<a name="FNanchor_17_30" id="FNanchor_17_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_30" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and the unexplained antithesis
underlying our knowledge of nature, attach themselves equally
to every possible conception of the universe, religious or irreligious,
common-sense or metaphysical. They have no special
connection with our argument from Design, and ought not in
fairness to be brought as objections against it.</p>

<p>The more real question just now is, whether Paley's mechanical
analogy was to blame for introducing the problem
of cosmical matter into the discussion.</p>

<p>On this question the opinions of competent and unprejudiced
judges disagree. By an eminent and accomplished writer the
case is summed up as follows, in the Harveian Oration for 1865.
Having previously included the material factor under mechanical
adaptation as distinguished from art in the highest sense, Dr.
Acland goes on to say (page 13): "The illustration of the watch so
quaintly employed by Nieuwentyt, and so entirely appropriated
by Paley, only in a coarse way suggests the parallel between
infinite art and common mechanical skill. It has done some mischief
to the cause it advocates, by making familiar a rude illustration,
which minds without imagination, or void of constructive
power, have accepted as a recognised explanation of the
<em>method of operation</em> by an Infinite Creative Will."</p>

<p>Paley's critics should however observe, that he did not
himself intend the objectionable inference. Probably he never
even perceived that it might be drawn from his comparison.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Abstract inquiries connected with Theism, he banished to the
end of his book, where they are discussed in a manner little
calculated to satisfy any readers who have ever felt them as
substantial difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_18_31" id="FNanchor_18_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_31" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But then, he would most likely have
referred these persons to the writings of professed metaphysicians.
It may be wise for us to take warning both by what
Paley did and by what he left undone. Some deeper questions
are indispensable to the argument from Design, but we shall
follow his example so far as to avoid such disquisitions as were
current in his day under the name of metaphysics. On
the other hand we shall draw the required data from that
critical Fact-philosophy of Mind and Human Nature, which
forms to so many thinkers the birth-star of a new science, one
amongst the rising hopes of our nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Meantime, our business on hand is to rebut the present
accusation of proving too much, brought against Paley's analogy.
We shall try to complete our answer by setting his argument
in the point of view under which he evidently meant it to be
looked at.</p>

<p>Either as an illustration or as a means of proof, Analogy
need not hold in more than a single point; provided only that
this single point is clear and well-established&mdash;resting, for
example, on a moral law or a causal <em>nexus</em>. Any one who
desires to make an analytical investigation into this law of
inference will receive valuable aid from Ueberweg's Logic,
§§ 131 and 2, particularly if compared with § 129.</p>

<p>To a common-sense mind we may give sufficient satisfaction
by adducing one or two good analogies. Thus, for instance,
the duties of a religious minister are often explained by saying
that he ought to be the shepherd of his flock; that is, his
relation to his people ought to resemble that of the shepherd
to his sheep. We all understand how truly is here expressed
a world of watchful care. But are all points of the relation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
be implied? May the spiritual pastor ever become the slayer
or the salesman of his flock?</p>

<p>Again,&mdash;writers upon political subjects some years ago used
very commonly to quote from the days of Alfred the Great supposed
precedents for our most modern constitutional <i lang="la">dicta</i>. In
many cases the thing defended was a legitimate outgrowth of
the precedent cited; but to pronounce the two <em>identical</em> seemed
sufficiently absurd. In confutation of some such absurdities,
clever men argued that the body corporate has, like the individual
body, its childhood, growth, and maturity. The argument
became generally accepted, and got extended to the distinctions
between healthy increase and sickly degeneration, with
other like inferences. The further conclusion was next drawn,
that every national body resembles the human frame in a
necessary decay, and inevitable mortality. Now, whatever
opinion may be entertained as to the fact of a death-rate of
nationalities, nothing seems more certain than that those
who first employed the comparison never contemplated this
particular corollary. Whether their first use of it was wise
or unwise, has been, like Paley's Watch-analogy, a matter of
some considerable dispute.</p>

<p>The general subject of Analogy, rightly or wrongly extended,
admits of wider illustration.</p>

<p>Simile and metaphor are often compressed analogies, and
many of them gain in beauty from expansion. Pope's celebrated
comparison of the traveller ascending the Alps with the
student who scales the heights of literature; and how</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise;"</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>is a good example of a poet's successfully expanding his own
thought. Still more exquisitively true to nature is the final
parallel drawn in Coleridge's description of the divided friends
who stood apart,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Like cliffs which had been rent asunder,"</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>while the marks of a former union lingered indestructible.
Perhaps few readers of "Christabel" ever looked at Lodore,
and "its scars remaining," without feeling how aptly they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
represent traces of thought and affection engraved upon the
soul of man, deeper and more imperishable than the primæval
rocks between which the "dreary sea" now flows.</p>

<p>The wonderful force of many among Shakespeare's metaphors
is derived from compressed analogy. But by expanding</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"The slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune,"</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>we should form no better conception of the goddess; and the
next line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,"</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>might easily be turned into nonsense! Like Paley's "watch,"
the "sea" holds true only in one point. Shakespeare had
before his eye the image of multitudinous vastness. But what
arms could we take up to stem the billows of a swelling
tide?</p>

<p>No one can read many commentators on the Scripture
without feeling how groundless are numberless conclusions
arrived at by extending Scriptural analogies beyond their just
limits. Preachers and platform speakers are still more guilty.
Not content with straining Holy Writ, they add to the mischief
by pressing into their service comparisons of double meaning.
The above quoted word "sea," has long been a much-enduring
similitude in its relation to the countries and islands of the
earth. What is it really to us, the earth's inhabitants? Our
highway and bond of union? or a waste of waters given to
divide rivals, as Horace phrases it, "<i lang="la">Oceano dissociabili</i>"?
The last is the oldest metaphor.<a name="FNanchor_19_32" id="FNanchor_19_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_32" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Enough has been said upon various analogies to show
how frequently even in their widest use (that of illustration),
the effect of extending them beyond their one salient
point, is utter confusion. And with respect to illative
analogy, this rule becomes obviously more stringent still. Paley
meant it to be observed strictly as regards his own analogous
reasoning.</p>

<p>But the caution itself must be cautiously applied, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
salient point on which the inference turns is too superficial, or
too weak to stand alone. And this is the very thing we have
to discuss next,&mdash;because a <em>second</em> accusation brought against
the argument from Design is, that by reason of weakness in
its pivot, it proves far too little.</p>

<p>This second charge is less usual amongst popular than
scientific writers, and most of us may learn something by
sifting it. Their position may be described in few words as
standing thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>All examples which men can, of their own knowledge,
connect with Design, fall under one sole class, and from this
class alone they can argue. It contains the products of human
workmanship and manufacture&mdash;and nothing else. By its
characteristic processes (which together with their result make
the sum of what we know about this class) it is so essentially
dissociated from the products of Nature, that any appearance
of design common between them must be pronounced superficial
in the absence of stronger <em>nexus</em>. But since proof of
such <em>nexus</em> remains wanting, Paley's analogy is worthless. It
will be observed that the effect of this position is to sever
between human works and natural things quite as completely
as did the popular objection which we put first in our list of
assaults upon Paley. Yet, though these conclusions may seem
suspiciously coincident, the grounds of argument are really
distinct. Scientific persons do not compare two objects
natural and artificial, nor yet their two sets of constituents,
and say, "These are unlike." They argue rather that the
relative or proportionate likeness asserted is insufficiently
made out, and that when it is said "Design implies a designer,"
people are speaking of design worked out in the known way
of workmen. We (they observe) need not <em>deny</em> a designer of
the world, but we desiderate evidence of his actual workmanship.
By this we shall know that he first conceived and then
realized the alleged design. We do not feel convinced by
being shown certain organic <em>somethings</em> in their perfect state,
and being told to observe how very like contrivances they are.
They may be very like, certainly, but we want assurances that
they can be nothing else. We want to have shown us some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
work <em>being</em> done, and to ascertain that it is carried on in a
workmanlike manner. Then we shall say with confidence,
Here is the active hand of a designer. To compress our
requisition into a single sentence,&mdash;We want not only to catch
Nature in the fact, but also to ascertain that Nature's way of
performing the fact has something essentially humanlike
about it.</p>

<p>To see our meaning clearly (add these objectors) take the
instance of some marvellous work of man's art previously
unknown to us. We could, if we perceived the <em>marks</em> of
human fabrication, reason from a watch, or some other well
known machine, to the conclusion that some person had
designed it. In other words, we should feel sure that we were
looking at a new product of skill, which differed from what
we had seen before in the degree of excellence attained. The
difference we feel in our transition from Art to Nature
appears, on the contrary, to be a difference not only between
more or less perfect products or processes, but a thorough
difference of kind in the whole <em>manner</em> of bringing about the
results placed before our eyes. Or put the case (they continue)
as a piece of circumstantial evidence. We say positively of
this or that machine, They are contrivances, things designed,
because we know the <em>history</em> of their manufacture. We feel
positive, because we are arguing from a plain patent fact to a
hidden but absolutely essential condition, without which the
fact could not exist. As regards natural products we have not
got the fact&mdash;we do not know the history of their production.
We cannot say, Here is the process, because the processes of
Nature are mostly unknown to us. Paley therefore would
have us assume the fact and argue from it; first to design,
next, to something more hidden still,&mdash;a Designer. Yet what
we <em>do</em> know of natural processes is not encouraging; there is
visible about them more unlikeness than likeness to the
processes employed by man. The truth may be surmised, that
Paley was always seeing in his own examples the footprints,
as he thought, of a Designer. Hence he affirmed Design, and
then argued back again in a never-ending circle. There is
really no reason why he should have travelled round such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
circuit. If his argument shows anything, it shows a Designer
at once.<a name="FNanchor_N_33" id="FNanchor_N_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_33" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<p>With some risk of tediousness, this last attack on Paley has
been detailed at great length, and placed (as the present writer
believes) in several of its most formidable shapes<a name="FNanchor_O_34" id="FNanchor_O_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_34" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>. But for
additional security of fair dealing with the strongest of all
objections&mdash;one which, if established, would be a death-blow to
all argument on the subject (since its <em>ultimatum</em> is unconditional
surrender)&mdash;for these reasons, then, and in order to
satisfy the most rigorous understanding, let it be finally
rehearsed in the words of a most eminent physicist whom no
one will accuse of haste, oversight, or credulity. To this
rehearsal the Professor adds what is to us more important still,&mdash;his
judgment on the point at issue.</p>

<p>But before quoting Professor Baden Powell, it may be worth
while to make two short notes on the few preceding paragraphs.
Let us take the last paragraph first.</p>

<p>It really does appear that marks of Design and the footprints
of a Designer are in common sense very nearly one and the same
thing. If we concentrate our attention on the former, we are
looking at an object on the side of certain properties,&mdash;that is,
of certain subjectively perceived relations. For instance, we
may think of the eye only as an optical instrument wonderfully
constituted, and enumerate the parts of its visual apparatus. But
the moment we speak of this apparatus as a provision <em>intentionally</em>
made for sight, we have introduced the idea of a Designer
in the strongest sense of the word. Now, it is difficult to think
of anything as an example of intelligent arrangement, and at
the same time give no hint even to our own thoughts of arranging
Intelligence. We can hardly look through a pane of glass
and admire the perfect transparency of <em>one</em> surface to the exclusion
of the <em>other</em>! We are not now speaking of what <em>might</em> be
done, if attempted by a man so profoundly skilled in analytics that</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"He could distinguish, and divide</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">A hair 'twixt south and south-west side."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>We are rather speaking of what it is <em>natural</em> to do. And it
may be doubted whether anybody thinks of a design <em>as</em>
design very long without thinking also of the Designer.</p>

<p>One other remark is suggested by the reference to <em>process</em>
as contradistinguished from <em>product</em>. Here, again, the real
question is, How far is such a distinction maintainable in fact?
Does it rest upon any definite separation in Nature? The
exact contradictory is the truth; taking the world as it is,
the distinction, though clear in thought, becomes essentially
fluent when objectively regarded. What we call a production
one moment, we say is a process the next. You have, for
example, a galvanic current, produced by certain chemical
combinations, and often a product <i lang="la">per se</i> of some importance.
Yet the current itself is a part of the electrotyping process.
Suppose this done, you have your electrotype&mdash;your coin,&mdash;a
hard fact,&mdash;a solid production, bright, beautiful, admirable!
But we will suppose you, while devising all this, to have a
further view;&mdash;the coin is to be employed in the process of
imposture. Here again comes a result&mdash;a great fraud committed;
but this is not all. The fraudulent procedure turns
out a very useful police-trap, and your chemical combination
sends the last actor on the scene to Portland, for at least ten
years. Consider in this brief history the scientific arrangements,
material conditions, and workmanlike execution, discernible in
its earlier parts; then, see how mind becomes gradually predominant,
and how Law, based on ideas of corrective justice,
enters the series. Add the judge and jury, and you admit the
force of intellect,&mdash;deliberating, deciding, putting further
activities in motion; till, perhaps, if the reformatory process
succeeds, Portland may have the honour of giving to society
the welcome product of (as times go) a passably honest man.
We might really frame a curious inquiry as respects this
flowing tide of process and production, production and process,
with its commingling currents and waves which seem to
interrupt each other like circles of diffracted light. We might
ask which of all these parts of the moving diorama is most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
distinctly human. I believe most people would say, those
scenes in which mind, not mere workmanship, is most evidently
discernible.</p>

<p>Professor Powell seems to have thought so too. The difficulty
we have been discussing he states as an objection
requiring solution.<a name="FNanchor_20_35" id="FNanchor_20_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_35" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In those cases most nearly approaching the nature of human
works, such as the varied and endless changes in matter going on in
the <em>laboratory of nature</em>, the results, even when most analogous to
those obtained in human laboratories, yet present no marks of the
process or of the means employed, by which to recognise the
analogous workman; and in all the grander productions, the incessant
evolutions of vegetable and animal life, which no human laboratory
can produce,&mdash;in the structure of earth and ocean, or the infinite
expanse of the heavens and their transcendent mechanism, still
further must we be from finding any analogy to the works of man,
or, by consequence, any analogy to a personal individual artificer."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next paragraph contains his own judgment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But the more just view of the case is that which arises from the
consideration that the real evidence is that of <em>mind</em> and <em>intelligence</em>;
for here we have a proper and strict analogy. <em>Mind</em> directing the
operations of the laboratory or the workshop, is no part of the <em>visible
apparatus</em>, nor are its operations seen in <em>themselves</em>&mdash;they are visible
only in their <em>effects</em>;&mdash;and from effects, however dissimilar in magnitude
or in kind, yet agreeing in the one grand condition of <em>order</em>,
<em>adjustment</em>, profound and recondite connexion and dependence, there
is the same evidence and outward manifestation of <span class="smcap">Invisible Intelligence</span>,
as vast and illimitable as the universe throughout which those
manifestations are seen."</p></blockquote>

<p>This second extract may be analysed into distinct propositions
somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In a manufactory,&mdash;</p>

<p>Mind is no part of the visible apparatus&mdash;nor are its operations
visible,&mdash;</p>

<p>But the effects make the operations manifest.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>In the universe,&mdash;</p>

<p>Effects may be seen differing from Human productions in
many ways,&mdash;but agreeing in one common characteristic,&mdash;order&mdash;adjustment&mdash;hidden
interdependence.</p>

<p>Such effects make manifest the operation of an Invisible
Intelligence as vast as the Universe itself.</p>

<p>The majority of people might suppose this a conclusive
inference from Nature to the Being of a Personal God. But
Professor Powell does not so intend it; and therefore some
readers may feel disposed to blame his use of words. It is,
however, only fair that before so doing, they should carefully
consider his whole mode of apprehending the subject in its
completeness. And the easiest way of understanding Powell
is, most probably, to compare him with Paley.</p>

<p>The latter is confident that when he has derived the design
and arrangement of the world from a mind analogous to the
mind of man, but immeasurably vast as the Universe which
man inhabits,&mdash;little more need be said. He thinks the infinite
intelligence thus demonstrated, is clearly no other than the
Great First Cause, and Creator of all things. "Contrivance, if
established, appears to me to prove everything which we wish
to prove." This sentence begins Chap. xxiii., and the rest of
Paley's Natural Theology is intended to demonstrate and verify
its correctness.</p>

<p>Powell thinks that the step from a mind or intelligence,
even if conceived illimitable as the Universe, to a First Cause,
Supreme Mind, or Moral Cause, is a very much longer ascent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_P_36" id="FNanchor_P_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_36" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
than Paley thought it. By these latter terms he meant&mdash;as
Paley did&mdash;the Divine Personality believed in by Theists, and
evidenced, <em>first</em>, as mind by a reign of law, order, and arrangement,
so far as the world can evidence Him;&mdash;but manifest,
<em>secondly</em>, in His higher nature as the fountain and originator
of law&mdash;that is, a true Cause, a manifestation due to the causal
structure of our own human minds. The point of difference is
the length of the step to be taken from Law to Causation; but
Powell agrees with his predecessor in asserting it, though
arduous, to be absolutely safe. The point he insists on is that
we cannot take it by a contemplation of the world without us
only. "Ever-present <em>mind</em>" he says,<a name="FNanchor_21_37" id="FNanchor_21_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_37" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> "is a direct inference
from the universal order of nature, or rather only another mode
of expressing it. But of the <em>mode</em> of existence of that mind
we can infer nothing."</p>

<p>From this view he draws conclusions in opposite directions.
Pantheism,<a name="FNanchor_22_38" id="FNanchor_22_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_38" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the co-existence or identification of mind with
matter, "is at best a mere gratuitous hypothesis, and as such
wholly unphilosophical in itself, and leading to many preposterous
consequences." There are also grounds on which Theism
appears certain and Pantheism extravagant, absurd, and contradictory.<a name="FNanchor_23_39" id="FNanchor_23_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_39" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
To see these grounds we are to carry out the
analogy given us by the common characteristics of order, adjustment,
and interdependence visible through their effects as
in the human workshop or laboratory, so, too, in the vast illimitable
Universe, and described in our second extract as
manifestations of Mind or invisible Intelligence. In the paragraph
immediately following that extract,<a name="FNanchor_24_40" id="FNanchor_24_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_40" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> he continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is by <em>analogy</em> with the exercise of intellect, and the volition, or
power of moral causation, of which we are conscious within ourselves,
that we speak of the <em>Supreme Mind</em> and <em>Moral Cause</em> of the
Universe, of whose operation, order, arrangement and adaptation,
are the external manifestations. <em>Order</em> implies what by <em>analogy</em> we
call <em>intelligence</em>; subserviency to an observed end implies intelligence
<em>foreseeing</em> which by analogy, we call <em>Design</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>The last sentence of the paragraph now quoted is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
remarkable. The eminent writer directs attention to a distinction
between two several inferences which can be drawn
from the observed manifestations of Order, and of Foresight.
From the first, he says, we infer Intelligence, from the latter
we infer Design. It seems singular that Powell should have
defined this distinction so clearly, and made no further use
of it.</p>

<p>He might naturally have insisted upon the separate and
diverse evidences thus afforded by the physical world. Amid
the variety of human minds, some may feel impressed by the
contemplation of Nature in one of these ways, some in the
other. To many persons the magnificent spectacle of a law-governed
Universe, infinitely manifold yet everywhere harmonious,
appears to justify the belief in one supreme Reason and
sovereign Will. Separate parts of this same Universe&mdash;or the
whole in its entirety of vastness&mdash;when considered as manifesting
purpose&mdash;that is, intentional adaptation to separate
ends or to one end&mdash;are to other minds a more convincing
line of thought.</p>

<p>With many writers on Natural Theology the different shades
of meaning implied in the word Design<a name="FNanchor_25_41" id="FNanchor_25_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_41" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> may prevent clearness
of conception in this respect. But our author (like Paley)
appears to use this word in its strongest signification.</p>

<p>And this usage of Powell's brings into view another point
in his reasoning even more singular than the one to which we
have just adverted. Surely, if in the natural world we observe
the manifestations of an Intelligence foreseeing an End, and
employing means in subserviency to that end, it seems strange
to conclude that respecting the mode of existence of such
Intelligence we can infer nothing, yet the words occur on the
very next page. It would seem almost an impossibility to
suppose such a mind existing as anything less than a Personality
under the twofold aspect of a Reason and a Will. Paley's
common sense drew this conclusion at once, and very profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
thinkers have agreed with Paley on the topic. "That," says
F. H. Jacobi, "which, in opposition to Fate, makes God into a
true God, is called Foresight. Where it is, there alone is
Reason; and where Reason is, there also is Foresight. Foresight
in itself is Spirit, and to that only which is of Spirit do those
feelings of admiration, awe, and love, which announce its
existence, correspond. We can indeed declare of any object
that it is beautiful or perfect, without previously knowing how
it became so, whether with or without the operation of Foresight;&mdash;but
the power which caused it so to be, <em>that</em> we cannot
admire, if it produced the object, without aim or purpose,
according to laws of mere Necessity of Nature."<a name="FNanchor_26_42" id="FNanchor_26_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_42" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>In point of fact Professor Powell was himself of the same
opinion, for in another place he writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now, the bare fact of order and arrangement is on all hands
undisputed, though commonly most inadequately understood and
appreciated.</p>

<p>"The inference of design, intention, forethought, is something
<em>beyond</em> the last mentioned truth, and not to be <em>confounded with it</em>.
This implies intelligent agency, or moral causation. Hence again, we
advance to the notion of distinct existence, or what is sometimes
called personality; and thence proceed to ascribe the other Divine
attributes and perfections as centring in that independent Being."<a name="FNanchor_27_43" id="FNanchor_27_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_43" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It appears only just to the Archdeacon that we should notice
this variation of language on the part of his censor.<a name="FNanchor_28_44" id="FNanchor_28_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_44" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Of this
variation itself the true account seems undoubtedly to be as
follows. The writer was engaged in tracing the progress of
conviction in his own mind. He first observes order, adjustment,
interdependence, throughout the Universe. Hence he is
penetrated by the impression of pervading Intelligence. Next,
he perceives that these results could never have taken place
unless foreseen and provided for by a designed subserviency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
means to ends, and this convinces him of the Personality of
that universal Mind. Finally, he draws, from the analysis
of Causation, a full definition of the great Originator of all
things.</p>

<p>The fact, however, remains that each of these gradations of
reasoning may be stated just as easily and more logically as
separate and convergent lines of thought, because each can be
rested on a separate combination of proofs. But the elucidation
of this subject cannot be compressed into few words, and must
be deferred to our fifth and sixth chapters.</p>

<p>Still there is a very peculiar and special satisfaction in following
the path of argument which persuaded an acute and
practised reasoner, accomplished in several departments of
knowledge, and himself of a turn of mind which would appear
naturally adapted to the utmost refinements of sceptical investigation.
We shall, therefore, now return to our comparison of
Powell with his predecessor.</p>

<p>These two distinguished writers do, in fact, come at last to
the same conclusion. But they reach it through a difference
in the paths travelled over by such logic of evidence as may
after all seem natural enough to a theological pleader on one
side, and on the other to a scientific physicist.</p>

<p>Professor Powell, of course, leads us more deeply than his
predecessor into the thorny thickets surrounding Natural
Theology. No one can read his essays without remarking the
subtlety of his thought, which to many readers appears over
refined, and to some as employed on points in themselves unimportant.
Mr. Baden Powell's own deliberate judgment was
the other way, as we find from the last<a name="FNanchor_29_45" id="FNanchor_29_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_45" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of his considerable
performances on our subject. "Points," he writes, "which
may be seen to involve the greatest difficulty to more profound
inquirers, are often such as do not occasion the least perplexity
to ordinary minds, but are allowed to pass without hesitation....
On the other hand, exceptions held forth as fatal by
the shallow caviller are seen by the more deeply reflecting in
all their actual littleness and fallacy."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>We may add that a subtle argument is often like a sharp
thin blade, cutting clean into the very heart of a question. If
it indeed prove a home thrust, few things ought to be more
fearlessly and cheerfully welcomed by those who desire to
dissect out the naked, intrinsic truth. We will, therefore,
dissect a little deeper, following the Professor's track of demonstration.</p>

<p>We find him, then, reaching down to a <em>septum</em>, or, as botanists
prefer to speak, a strong dissepiment between a <em>law of
Nature</em> or <em>physical causation</em>, and a <em>true Cause</em> in the highest
and most emphatic sense<a name="FNanchor_Q_46" id="FNanchor_Q_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_46" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>Such a separation is not to be sought from a writer of
Paley's date, when the modern notion of law was unformed,
or rather was in process of formation. Thus Newton's discoveries
were thought by many persons irreligious, because the
stability of the heavens appeared like something necessarily
determined. Respecting this opinion, Powell observes (and
from his point of view with truth), that "such necessity of
reason is the highest proof of design." Paley, on the contrary,
felt inclined to despair of discovering much evidence of Design
in Astronomy, but he looked upon the starry heavens as affording
the most ample and glorious confirmation of the agency of
an intelligent Creator, when proved from some other source.
In his next chapter (the 23rd) he proceeds to reprehend the
mistaken sense of law, growing up amongst physicists in his
own day. "It will," he says, "be made to take the place of
power, and still more, of intelligent power," and will "be assigned
for the cause of anything or of any property of anything
that exists." In this remark he shows his accustomed
penetration. Law, antecedent and consequent, with their
series of physical evolutions, have been talked of by men who
confuse physics and metaphysics, as if they could thereby
account for a whole universe.<a name="FNanchor_30_47" id="FNanchor_30_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_47" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Now, from this cloudy confusion<a name="FNanchor_R_48" id="FNanchor_R_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_48" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>,
Professor Powell is exempt. He accepts (as obviously
he must accept) the natural-science idea of law, which looks at
it as an orderly expression of force, and tells us that "law and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
order, physical causation and uniformity of action are the elevated
manifestations of Divinity, creation and providence."<a name="FNanchor_31_49" id="FNanchor_31_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_49" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
But from the conception of Mind or Intelligence thus given us,
which, though invisible to the eye, is yet, in its effects, plainly
visible, he distinguishes, over and over again, the idea of a true
originating first Cause.<a name="FNanchor_32_50" id="FNanchor_32_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_50" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> We see the necessity of a moral Cause
as distinguished from a physical antecedent, when we survey
Nature. But Nature does not contain the idea in an explicit
shape. She only necessitates its acceptance. This idea, we
find, he tells us, manifest in our own moral nature,&mdash;by analogy
we discern it in the Divine. He likewise severely blames
those who commingle in words the two contrasted thoughts and
lines of inference, and mentions Coleridge and Sterling<a name="FNanchor_33_51" id="FNanchor_33_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_51" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> by way
of example. As concerns his own mode of establishing the idea
of causation in its proper and peculiar force, Professor Powell
agrees with a large number of metaphysicians, ancient and
modern. It might seem superfluous to name as an instance the
late Dean Mansel, were not a passage in his "Prolegomena" so
full of good matter on the topic.<a name="FNanchor_34_52" id="FNanchor_34_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_52" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>In this view of causation, then, Powell advanced nothing
new. But what he did advance was really valuable. The man
who can rise no higher than law or succession as he sees it
impressed on outward nature, stands in a totally different
position from the man whose insight into Reason and Will has
shown him the idea of true Causation. For, he has seen that
whoever is the author of his own act, does something which
puts in movement a new series of antecedence and consequence,&mdash;a
new train of events, the issue of which no man can foresee;&mdash;though
of what has come, and is coming, he, the individual
man, is the truly responsible cause<a name="FNanchor_S_53" id="FNanchor_S_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_53" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>. But if <em>he</em> can introduce
into the order of the outward world a new antecedent carrying
after it a chain of new consequents, what shall he think respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the absolute Cause of all worlds, things and beings, the
thinker himself included? Who shall persuade him to deny
the reasonableness of a Providence following creation? Who
can reprove the man when he feels and asserts his own moral
power, for a belief in Miracles? Above all, who will demonstrate
that prayer is inefficacious, if we can rise (as Baden
Powell says we can rise) "by <em>analogy</em> with the exercise of
intellect, and the volition, or power of moral causation, of
which we are conscious within ourselves, to the Supreme Mind
and Moral Cause of the universe?"</p>

<p>It is no slight praise to say that Professor Powell clearly saw,
and no less clearly expressed, a truth not always apprehended
among physicists. By giving it expression, he rendered a substantial
service to Natural Theology. It is, indeed, a serious
drawback and impediment to Natural Theologians that their
argument requires some acquaintance with more than one wide
field of knowledge. They have to reason from the material
world,&mdash;they have also to reason from the world of mind; and
in countries like England, France, and Germany, where division
of labour penetrates every calling, literary as well as manufacturing,
a combination of this sort is a matter of infrequent
occurrence. To this retarding circumstance may be ascribed
the want of progress in several mixed sciences,<a name="FNanchor_35_54" id="FNanchor_35_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_54" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> which, like
the subject we are treating, occupy two distinct tracts of
border-land territory.</p>

<p>The separating wall between Law and Cause built up by
Professor Powell, was founded on fact, and will probably remain
unshaken. But he added to it a theoretical limitation
of the term, Natural Theology, which, like many changes in
verbal usage, does not appear defensible,&mdash;particularly as its
bad effects are plainly shown in Professor Powell's own book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Within two pages of the passage on Causation last quoted, he
startles the unwary reader by saying (p. 173) that "Natural
Theology confessedly 'proves too little,' because it cannot rise to
the metaphysical idea or scriptural representation of God." It
is generally vain to inquire what may be meant by "Metaphysical."
Few people are aware that everybody, learned or
unlearned, talks metaphysics either well or ill; and usually (as
M. Jourdain talked prose) without knowing it. The epithet
"metaphysical" figures often enough as another name for what
is unintelligible;&mdash;and most Englishmen apply it to all "ideas"
not strictly commercial or practical. Here it seems to stand
along with Scripture, in opposition to Natural Theology; while
the latter term is in turn opposed to the science of the human
mind. Yet does not Powell distinctly trace a Mind and Intelligence
analogous to the mind and intelligence of Man, throughout
the world of outward Nature; and does he not further
determine that this same analogy, fairly carried out, leads to
what he <em>now</em> calls "the metaphysical idea, or scriptural representation
of God?" In other words, when discussing the
question of Evidence, he finds Mind pervading outward Nature,&mdash;he
treats Mind as the ordering and sovereign part of the
Natural world, which visibly shows the effect of its invisible
direction, and bids us follow up this higher nature in its
analogies to God, of Whose operation the order and arrangement
of the Universe are external manifestations. But,
when he speaks of Natural Theology, that higher nature
seems to disappear; intellect, volition, and the power of
moral causation, slip out of sight, and are blotted from his
catalogue of natural facts. Human nature must thus be
treated as no part of universal Nature, in order that a needlessly
narrow and purely theoretical fence may be drawn
round the science of Natural Theology! Natural Theology
and Natural Religion are, in truth, terms originally adopted
as mere antitheses to Revelation. The <em>first</em> signifies what
mankind might have known, or may know, of the Divine
Being, prior to, or apart from, any direct message sent by
Himself. The <em>second</em> is intended to comprehend those relations
between that Divine Being and ourselves, which must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
ensue immediately upon the acceptance of Theism.<a name="FNanchor_36_55" id="FNanchor_36_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_55" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The <em>ideas</em>
expressed by these two terms are as old as Revelation itself,&mdash;a
strong reason why their meaning should not be lightly
altered.<a name="FNanchor_37_56" id="FNanchor_37_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_56" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But this antithetic usage was never intended to prejudge
the question whether the results of Natural Theology and
Religion do not coincide to a very great extent with the teaching
of revelation. Much less was there any idea of answering this
question in the negative, as a hasty reader of certain isolated
passages in Professor Powell's book might easily be led to
answer it.<a name="FNanchor_38_57" id="FNanchor_38_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_57" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Our strictures may be aptly concluded by a quotation taken
from another recent writer. Professor Newman understands
the evidence of Design in the same breadth of meaning which
we have attached to it. Under it he comprehends the evidence
of Mind naturally known to us, as may be seen by the following
extracts:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A lung," says Mr. Newman,<a name="FNanchor_39_58" id="FNanchor_39_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_58" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "bears a certain relation to the air,
a gill to the water, the eye to light, the mind to truth, human hearts
to one another: is it gratuitous and puerile to say that these relations
imply design? There is no undue specification here, no antagonist
argument, no intrusion of human artifice: we take the things fresh
from nature. In saying that lungs <em>were intended</em> to breathe, and eyes
to see, we imply an argument from Fitness to Design, which carries
conviction to the overwhelming majority of cultivated as well as uncultivated
minds.... If such a fact stood alone in the universe,
and no other existences <em>spoke of Design</em>, it would probably remain a
mere enigma to us; but when the whole human world is pervaded
by similar instances, not to see a Universal Mind in nature appears
almost a brutal insensibility.... Of the physical structure of
mind, no one pretends to know anything; but this does not weaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
our conviction that the mind was meant to discern truth. Why
should any philosopher resist this judgment? One thing might
justify him; namely, if there were strong <i lang="la">à priori</i> reasons for disbelieving
that Mind exists anywhere except in man. But the case is
just the reverse. That puny beings who are but of yesterday, and
presently disappear, should alone possess that which of all things is
highest and most wonderful, is <i lang="la">à priori</i> exceedingly unplausible. As
Socrates and Cicero have pointedly asked: 'Whence have we picked
it up?' Its source is not in ourselves: there must surely be a
source beyond us. Thus the tables are turned: we must <i lang="la">primâ facie</i>
expect to find Mind in the Universe, acting on some stupendous
scale, and of course imperfectly understood by us. Consequently,
such Fitnesses as meet our view on all sides bring a reasonable
conviction that Design lies beneath them. To confess this, is to
confess the doctrine of an <em>intelligent Creator</em>, although we pretend
not to understand anything concerning the mode, stages, or time of
Creation. <em>Adding now the conclusions drawn from the Order of the
universe</em>, we have testimony, adapted to the cultivated judgment, that
there is a Boundless, Eternal, Unchangeable, Designing Mind, not
without whom this system of things coheres: and this Mind we
call <span class="smcap">God</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>To take stumbling-blocks out of the reader's way has been
the main object of this Chapter. It has discussed the meaning
and force of several words. The discussion may have seemed
somewhat intricate,&mdash;but if honest, and, so far as it goes,
thorough, no one will deny its utility. For facts are known to
us as words, and words are facts to our intellect, since they
express our apprehension of objects. They are, in brief, the
interpreters of a world-wide human consciousness. And in the
strength of consciousness our knowledge stands, if it does
stand;&mdash;unfaithful to consciousness, it must fall, and ought to
die the death of a traitor.<a name="FNanchor_40_59" id="FNanchor_40_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_59" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The word most discussed has been that one upon which
turns the best known argument by Natural Theology&mdash;"Design."
We trust also, that it may hereafter gain addi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>tional
clearness under sidelights from other trains of thought.<a name="FNanchor_41_60" id="FNanchor_41_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_60" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
And what next follows will be essentially a discussion of
thoughts and things&mdash;in which words are to be treated less as
their representatives, and more as our servants and implements.
For this Chapter will have been written to very little purpose
if the reader has failed to perceive that Natural Theology<a name="FNanchor_42_61" id="FNanchor_42_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_61" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
includes at the very least two distinct elements&mdash;two separate
sets of premises drawn from different sources. One of these
factors rests upon our human knowledge of the natural world
we live in&mdash;the other requires a deeper kind of knowledge, and
one far less cultivated upon inductive principles&mdash;the know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>ledge,
that is to say, of our own nature&mdash;our essential humanity
and self-ness.</p>

<p>The investigation of this last element is of paramount importance
for the purpose we have in hand, since, without some
ascertained principles and conditions of truth, men may fold
their hands and view all behind and above the moving diorama
of present impressions as ideas sublime but hopeless<a name="FNanchor_43_62" id="FNanchor_43_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_62" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>&mdash;too
high for us, who surely can never attain to them. The plan,
therefore, of this essay is to take from the point now reached
a fresh start&mdash;to set out, not from a consideration of what we
may desire to know, but of how much or how little can be
known, and the conditions of our knowing it.</p>

<p>An honest wish to be sure of one single thing soon shows us
the impediments we meet in making quite sure of anything.
Soon, also, we painfully learn that these impediments arise
from <em>two</em> persistent sets of causes. Difficulties on the one
hand occasioned by the obscurity, complication, or many-sidedness
of objects actually existing <i lang="la">in rerum naturâ</i>. Difficulties
on the other hand, which, like barnacles and remoræ attached
to a good ship's wooden bottom, act as drags and retardations
on our own apprehending faculties. Barnacle-like, they can
only be kept at a distance or detached by carefully-devised
contrivances. And these again give rise to troubles of other
kinds,&mdash;just as copper-sheathed keels or iron vessels are not
without their drawbacks.</p>

<p>The inquiry we propose will have a great collateral advantage,
both to him who doubts and to him who accepts Theism.
For we shall at least get rid of what may fairly be termed a
stupid prejudice. Persons who read and think little, are apt
to base upon their own ignorance a vague presumption that
the path of knowledge is plain and easy, until men try to
know God. <em>Then</em> all is hard; the pleasant path becomes a
rough and toilsome road. Others who read, but think less
than they read, are aware that very real obstacles beset all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
deep inquiry, yet form hazy and imperfect notions as to the
true extent of those obstacles. They little think how often
we are all obliged to accept and maintain first truths;&mdash;difficulties
objective, and difficulties subjective, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Of one practical conclusion resulting from these difficulties,
we may feel assured beforehand. Many objects of the greatest
interest and importance to truth can never be truly known as
they are in themselves;&mdash;our utmost hope is to know, not
them, but as much as we can discover respecting them. And
sometimes this limited knowledge is invaluable. If it does not
gratify our natural desire for speculation, it may often guide
and govern our lives. Unspeakably important, for example,
in itself and in its consequences, must be an affirmative
answer to our anxious question concerning the existence of
a God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Corollary.</span>&mdash;It plainly appears from what has been said,
that the knowledge of an "efficient cause" (in physics) does
not, and cannot, at all preclude the inquiry after a purpose or
"final cause"; but, on the contrary, leads to its investigation.
In a watch's action, the former is represented by the moving
power&mdash;that is, the spring; the latter, by the watch's function&mdash;that
of indicating hours, minutes, and seconds. Would any
uninformed person, examining a watch for the first time, and
knowing no more than what he sees,&mdash;be able to give to himself
any real account of the watch, if spring, train of wheel-work,
and pointers, were shown him; but <em>no</em> hint given of the
purpose and object of the <em>whole</em> construction? Now, to tell
him this, would be to convey the <em>idea</em>,&mdash;a principle which
resides in Mind, and in Mind alone;&mdash;and, so residing, leads
to intelligent adaptation;&mdash;that is, a law or laws apprehended
by the active exercise of certain mental faculties.</p>

<p>Let the intelligent reader ask himself whether <em>any</em> functional
structure can be comprehended on <em>any</em> lower terms?&mdash;As
however this latter question will be fully discussed further
on, it is unnecessary to say more respecting it at present.</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS TO
CHAPTER II.</h3>


<h4><a id="A.2"></a>A.&mdash;ON THE ABSTRACT REASONINGS INVOLVED IN
NATURAL THEOLOGY.</h4>

<p>In his discourse on Natural Theology, Lord Brougham writes thus
(p. 78):&mdash;"The whole reasoning proceeds necessarily upon the
assumption that there exists a being or thing separate from, and independent
of, matter, and conscious of its own existence, which we call
<em>mind</em>. For the argument is, 'Had I to accomplish this purpose, I
should have used some such means'; or, 'Had I used these means, I
should have thought I was accomplishing some such purpose.' Perceiving
the adaptation of the means to the end, the inference is, that
some being has acted as we should ourselves act, and with the same
views. But when we so speak, and so reason, we are all the while
referring to an intelligent principle or existence; we are referring to
our mind, and not to our bodily frame." ... "The belief
that mind exists is essential to the whole argument by which we
infer that the Deity exists. This belief ... is the foundation
of Natural Theology in all its branches; and upon the scheme of
materialism no rational, indeed no intelligible, account can be given
of a first cause, or of the creation or government of the universe."</p>

<p>In a foot-note, Lord Brougham adds:&mdash;"It is worthy of observation
that not the least allusion is made in Dr. Paley's work to the argument
here stated, although it is the foundation of the whole of Natural
Theology. Not only does this author leave entirely untouched the
argument <i lang="la">à priori</i> (as it is called), and also all the inductive arguments
derived from the phenomena of mind, but he does not even advert to
the argument upon which the inference of design must of necessity
rest&mdash;that design which is the whole subject of his book. Nothing
can more evince his distaste or incapacity for metaphysical researches.
He assumes the very position which alone sceptics dispute. In combating
him they would assert that he begged the whole question; for
certainly they do not deny, at least in modern times, the <em>fact</em> of adaptation.
As to the fundamental doctrine of causation, not the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
allusion is ever made to it in any of his writings,&mdash;even in his Moral
Philosophy."</p>

<p>It is when reviewing this last-named treatise that Dr. Whewell
remarks (History of Moral Philosophy, p. 169):&mdash;</p>

<p>"The fact is that Paley had no taste, and therefore we may be
allowed to say that he had little aptitude, for metaphysical disquisitions.
In this there would have been no blame, if he had not entered
into speculations which, if they were not metaphysically right, must
be altogether wrong. We often hear persons declare that they have
no esteem for metaphysics, and intend to shun all metaphysical reasonings;
and this is usually the prelude to some specimen of very <em>bad</em>
metaphysics: for I know no better term by which to designate the
process of misunderstanding and confounding those elements of truth
which are supplied by the relations of our own ideas. That Paley
had no turn or talent for the reasoning which depends on such relations,
is plain enough."</p>

<p>The reader may with little trouble collect for himself what is meant
by bad metaphysics from the following extracts. The first is Lord
Macaulay's criticism on the metaphysics of the Schools, which he introduces
into his essay on Francis Bacon, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By stimulating men to the discovery of useful truth, he" (Bacon)
"furnished them with a motive to perform the inductive process well
and carefully. His predecessors had been, in his phrase, not interpreters,
but anticipators of nature. They had been content with the
first principles at which they had arrived by the most scanty and
slovenly induction. And why was this? It was, we conceive, because
their philosophy proposed to itself no practical end&mdash;because it was
merely an exercise of the mind. A man who wants to contrive a new
machine or a new medicine has a strong motive to observe accurately
and patiently, and to try experiment after experiment. But a man
who merely wants a theme for disputation or declamation has no such
motive. He is therefore content with premises grounded on assumption,
or on the most scanty and hasty induction. Thus, we conceive,
the schoolmen acted. On their foolish premises they often argued
with great ability; and as their object was "assensum subjugare, non
res" (Nov. Org. I. Aph. 29), to be victorious in controversy, not to be
victorious over nature, they were consistent. For just as much logical
skill could be shown in reasoning on false as on true premises."<a name="FNanchor_44_63" id="FNanchor_44_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_63" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Of
course, if any genuine metaphysical philosophy exists at all, its right
and real object must be to try and discover true premises of the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
abstract sort&mdash;premises, the truth of which affects the procedure of all
the ancillary series.<a name="FNanchor_45_64" id="FNanchor_45_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_64" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Our next quotation contains Hume's sentence of execution rather
than critique upon metaphysics as he saw them in connection with
dogmatic theology. First, for his fiery anathema:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what
havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume of divinity
or School metaphysics, for instance, let us ask, <i>Does it contain any
abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?</i> No. <i>Does it contain
any experimental reasoning concerning matters of fact and existence?</i>
No. Commit it then to the flames: For it can contain nothing but
sophistry and illusion." (Inquiry concerning Human Understanding,
§ XII.) Alas for certain of Hume's own speculations!</p>

<p>The student of Positivism knows how this fierce invective was
echoed and re-echoed by Comte and his followers. They, however,
omitted the qualifying word "School," which Hume prefixed to metaphysics.
With Comte, metaphysic of every kind was "anathema
maranatha"; and even psychology got excommunicated, by way of
making "a clean sweep."</p>

<p>Hume, on the contrary, had an idea of what philosophy ought to
be, and thus outlined his preparation for a Metaphysic of the Future:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The only method of freeing learning, at once, from these abstruse
questions, is to inquire seriously into the nature of human understanding,
and show, from an exact analysis of its powers and capacity, that
it is by no means fitted for such remote and abstruse subjects. We
must submit to this fatigue in order to live at ease ever after: and
must cultivate true metaphysics with some care, in order to destroy
the false and adulterate. Indolence, which, to some persons, affords
a safeguard against this deceitful philosophy, is, with others, overbalanced
by curiosity; and despair, which at some moments prevails,
may give place afterwards to sanguine hopes and expectations. Accurate
and just reasoning is the only catholic remedy, fitted for all persons
and all dispositions; and is alone able to subvert that abstruse
philosophy and metaphysical jargon, which, being mixed up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
popular superstition, renders it in a manner impenetrable to careless
reasoners, and gives it the air of science and wisdom.</p>

<p>"Besides this advantage of rejecting, after deliberate inquiry, the
most uncertain and disagreeable part of learning, there are many
positive advantages, which result from an accurate scrutiny into the
powers and faculties of human nature. It is remarkable concerning
the operations of the mind, that though most intimately present to us,
yet, whenever they become the object of reflection, they seem involved
in obscurity; nor can the eye readily find those lines and boundaries
which discriminate and distinguish them. The objects are too fine to
remain long in the same aspect or situation, and must be apprehended,
in an instant, by a superior penetration, derived from nature, and improved
by habit and reflection. It becomes, therefore, no inconsiderable
part of science barely to know the different operations of the mind,
to separate them from each other, to class them under their proper
heads, and to correct all that seeming disorder in which they lie involved,
when made the object of reflection and inquiry. This task of
ordering and distinguishing, which has no merit when performed with
regard to external bodies, the objects of our senses, rises in its value
when directed towards the operations of the mind, in proportion to
the difficulty and labour which we meet with in performing it. And if
we can go no farther than this mental geography, or delineation of the
distinct parts and powers of the mind, it is at least a satisfaction to go
so far; and the more obvious this science may appear (and it is by no
means obvious), the more contemptible still must the ignorance of it
be esteemed, in all pretenders to learning and philosophy." Ibid.
Section I.</p>

<p>It seems worth while to consider what the effects might have been,
had Hume been faithful to his own idea.<a name="FNanchor_46_65" id="FNanchor_46_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_65" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In the first place he would
have remedied the weakness pointed out by Macaulay in the premises
of the schoolmen, which were in fact little better than sententious
maxims often derived from mistranslated passages of Scripture, one-sided
opinions of the Fathers, and other sources of doubtful value.
These, Hume would have abscided altogether, and rested his "true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
metaphysics" upon such principles as survived a searching inquiry
into the conditions of Human knowledge. Hence, secondly, he would
have rendered a great service to Divinity itself, which can never be
benefited by such arguments as have been described, but must look
for a safe alliance to a synthesis of Faith and Reason. And in the
third place he might have probably given to his country a critical
Philosophy adapted to English modes of Thought. Kant's mind was
fired by a spark of Hume's kindling, but when we think what might
have been the shape and acceptance of Kant in this country had Hume
heralded him by a critique of Reason, it is impossible to read the
great Scotchman's writings without a feeling of disappointment.<a name="FNanchor_47_66" id="FNanchor_47_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_66" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>It would however be unjust to omit the fact that Hume did really
entertain a serious intention of dealing with these difficult questions.
Thus much is expressed in his earliest work, and we may conjecture
that literary disappointment was at least one cause of that later preference
for "easy philosophy" which contrasts so strongly with the
programme of his treatise on Human Nature. Few programmes were
ever more vigorously outlined, than the ensuing.</p>

<p>"From hence," he says, "in my opinion, arises that common prejudice
against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds, even amongst
those who profess themselves scholars, and have a just value for every
other part of literature. By metaphysical reasonings, they do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
understand those on any particular branch of science, but every kind
of argument, which is any way abstruse, and requires some attention
to be comprehended. We have so often lost our labour in such
researches, that we commonly reject them without hesitation, and
resolve, if we must for ever be a prey to errors and delusions, that
they shall at least be natural and entertaining. And, indeed, nothing
but the most determined scepticism, along with a great degree of
indolence, can justify this aversion to metaphysics. For, if truth be
at all within the reach of human capacity, 'tis certain it must lie very
deep and abstruse; and to hope we shall arrive at it without pains,
while the greatest geniuses have failed with the utmost pains, must
certainly be esteemed sufficiently vain and presumptuous. I pretend
to no such advantage in the philosophy I am going to unfold, and
would esteem it a strong presumption against it, were it so very easy
and obvious."&mdash;Treatise on Human Nature, Introduction, p. 12.</p>

<p>In these sentences Hume has sufficiently condemned the vulgar
objections brought against abstract reasoning. Deep and difficult
questions can be discussed in no other manner; and what is often
called a popular treatise on some subject of philosophic inquiry can
never be more than a statement of its writer's opinions, or possibly of
his sentimental prejudices.</p>

<p>The next paragraph contains Hume's earliest<a name="FNanchor_48_67" id="FNanchor_48_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_67" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> sketch of that critical
inquiry into Human Nature on which he proposed to base all
future philosophy. It is of course deeply interesting.</p>

<p>"'Tis evident that all the sciences have a relation, greater or less,
to human nature; and that however wide any of them may seem to
run from it, they still return back by one passage or another. Even
<em>Mathematics</em>, <em>Natural Philosophy</em>, and <em>Natural Religion</em>, are in some
measure dependent on the science of <span class="smcap">Man</span>; since they lie under the
cognizance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties.</p>

<p>"'Tis impossible to tell what changes and improvements we might
make in these sciences were we thoroughly acquainted with the extent
and force of human understanding, and could explain the nature of
the ideas we employ, and of the operations we perform in our reasonings.
And these improvements are the more to be hoped for in natural
religion, as it is not content with instructing us in the nature of
superior powers, but carries its views further, to their disposition
towards us, and our duties towards them; and consequently we our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>selves
are not only the beings that reason, but also one of the objects
concerning which we reason."</p>

<p>"If, therefore, the sciences of mathematics, natural philosophy,
and natural religion, have such a dependence on the knowledge of
man, what may be expected in the other sciences, whose connection
with human nature is more close and intimate?... In these
four sciences of <em>Logic</em>, <em>Morals</em>, <em>Criticism</em>, and <em>Politics</em>, is comprehended
almost everything which it can any way import us to be
acquainted with, or which can tend either to the improvement or
ornament of the human mind.</p>

<p>"Here then is the only expedient, from which we can hope for
success in our philosophical researches, to leave the tedious lingering
method, which we have hitherto followed, and instead of taking now
and then a castle or village on the frontier, to march up directly to
the capital or centre of these sciences, to human nature itself; which
being once masters of, we may everywhere else hope for an easy victory.
From this station we may extend our conquests over all those
sciences which more intimately concern human life, and may afterwards
proceed at leisure to discover more fully those which are the
objects of pure curiosity. There is no question of importance, whose
decision is not comprised in the science of man; and there is none,
which can be decided with any certainty, before we become acquainted
with that science. In pretending, therefore, to explain the principles
of human nature, we in effect propose a complete system of the
sciences, built on a foundation almost entirely new, and the only one
upon which they can stand with any security."<a name="FNanchor_49_68" id="FNanchor_49_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_68" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Ibid. pp. 13-14.</p>

<p>The present writer has a special interest in citing these passages,
because they do in fact defend as well as describe the procedure of
his very next chapter.</p>

<p>Such then at an early age was Hume's keen-edged critical appreciation
of those intellectual conditions required for a Philosophy of
the Sciences, or as he calls it, the "true Metaphysics." In order to
supplement his clever and clear idea by a very practical delineation of
the metaphysical territory, we turn to another great thinker, the
founder of our modern natural science, the great Lord Verulam.<a name="FNanchor_50_69" id="FNanchor_50_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_69" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>Bacon divides Philosophy according to its objects, which are three,&mdash;God,
Nature, Man. Take, then, Natural Philosophy; it is well
said that the truth of nature lies deeply hidden, and it is also well
said that the Producer imitates Nature. Natural Philosophy divides
itself accordingly into the inquisition of causes and the production
of effects; it is both speculative and operative. There is indeed
an intercourse between causes and effects, and both these kinds of
knowledge. All true and fruitful Natural Philosophy has a double
scale or ladder,&mdash;ascendent and descendent; ascending from experiment
to first causes; descending thence to fresh experiment and
always fresh productiveness.<a name="FNanchor_51_70" id="FNanchor_51_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_70" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The ascending half is divided into two moieties, of which one is the
science of Physics, the other of Metaphysics. In distinguishing these
two, Bacon so far agrees with antiquity as to say,&mdash;"That Physic
supposes in nature only a being and moving and natural necessity;
whereas Metaphysic supposes also a Mind and Idea. For that which
I shall say comes perhaps to this."<a name="FNanchor_52_71" id="FNanchor_52_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_71" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Or, to put it in another light,
he writes elsewhere:&mdash;"Physique, taking it according to the derivation,
and not according to our idiom for medicine, is situate in a
middle term or distance between natural history and Metaphysique.
For natural history describeth the variety of things; Physique, the
causes, but variable or respective causes; and Metaphysique, the
fixed and constant causes."<a name="FNanchor_53_72" id="FNanchor_53_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_72" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>In order to clear the way for <em>his</em> Metaphysic of the future, Bacon
subjects what had been called by that name to a critical process. He
separates from it a kind of theoretical philosophy, the attainment of
which he considered doubtful, though he desired that it should be
attempted, as the ultimate goal of human wisdom. The object of
the separation is, therefore, to leave his metaphysical science within
the limits of what is certainly attainable,&mdash;a fact not to be lost sight
of in its relation to the abstract subjects in which we are now specially
interested. The separated realm of knowledge Bacon calls "First
and Summary Philosophy"; it is a "common ancestor to all knowledge,"<a name="FNanchor_54_73" id="FNanchor_54_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_73" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
whereas Metaphysic belongs to the philosophy of Nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
It is at the apex of his pyramid of knowledges,<a name="FNanchor_55_74" id="FNanchor_55_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_74" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>&mdash;the basis being a
collection of natural facts&mdash;the "stage next the basis," (an investigation
of causes variable and immersed in material existence,) is
called "Physique&mdash;the stage next the vertical point is Metaphysique."<a name="FNanchor_56_75" id="FNanchor_56_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_75" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
To enter clearly into Bacon's meaning, two questions
should be answered: one, what was the wisdom that older Metaphysicians
pursued, respecting which he did not himself feel sanguine?
and the other, what remained in his thought the province of practical
Metaphysique?</p>

<p>It is obvious that a wisdom which shall gather up all that every
other realm of wisdom produces, cast it into Thought's winepress,
and extract the rarest vintage of Truth, has been the vision of every
age since men began to inquire and to reason. If this wisdom were
possible, it would become to us an alphabet of the Universe; we
should obtain a clear insight into the world as it is, and the foregone
work of its Creator. Each of us might truthfully say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Der du die Welt umschweifst,</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Geschäftiger Geist, wie nah' fühl ich mich dir!"</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>It needs but a glance at Bacon's indefinite outline of a First and
Summary Philosophy,<a name="FNanchor_57_76" id="FNanchor_57_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_76" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> to see that it must always be greeted by two
opposite sentences of condemnation. A large section of its censors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
will pronounce the meagreness of its contents "a gentle riddance,"
or perhaps describe the contents themselves still more harshly as
"rubbish shot here." Another section may compare all that it leaves
for Metaphysics to the year without its spring, or Shakespeare's
masterpiece of philosophy with the part of Hamlet left out.</p>

<p>Let us see then how the reserved province was parcelled out.&mdash;Bacon
himself remarks:&mdash;"It may fairly therefore now be asked,
what is left remaining for Metaphysic? Certainly nothing beyond
nature; but of nature itself much the most excellent part." Most
excellent because "Physic handles that which is most inherent in
matter and therefore transitory, and Metaphysic that which is more
abstracted and fixed. And again, that Physic supposes in nature only
a being and moving and natural necessity: whereas Metaphysic supposes
also a mind and idea."<a name="FNanchor_58_77" id="FNanchor_58_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_77" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>This search into the Mind of Nature is divided into the investigation
of <em>two</em> kinds of causes, still called the Formal and the Final. Bacon's
doctrine of Forms&mdash;the Philosophy in which is embraced "Natura
naturans"&mdash;nature engendering nature&mdash;the Queen of Art&mdash;and the
Regent of Production, constitutes one of the most difficult parts of the
Novum Organum, the Advancement, and the De Augmentis; and may
have been one chief provocative to King James' irreverent similitude.
It might, according to some writers, even now prove a veritable
"peace of God" could we only grasp its full meaning. "From the
discovery of Forms," says Bacon, "results truth in speculation and
freedom in operation."<a name="FNanchor_59_78" id="FNanchor_59_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_78" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> And his latest commentator believes that
this field of discovery has not been truly explored, because its very
idea has been only imperfectly apprehended. The whole question,
however, belongs to a future Chapter of this Essay, where we propose
examining the Law of Production in its most refined and abstract
shape. Yet one further remark may be allowed here. According to
Francis Bacon, one "respect which ennobles this part of Metaphysic,
is that it enfranchises the power of men to the greatest liberty, and
leads it to the widest and most extensive field of operation....
For physical causes give light and direction to new inventions in
similar matter. But whosoever knows any Form, knows also the
utmost possibility of superinducing that nature upon every variety of
matter, and so is less restrained and tied in operation, either to the
basis of the matter or to the condition of the efficient."<a name="FNanchor_60_79" id="FNanchor_60_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_79" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>We are more concerned, at the present stage of this Essay, with
the <em>second</em> portion of Bacon's Metaphysique&mdash;the Inquiry into Final
Causes. They are described in the Advancement as not having been
neglected before its great Author's time, but as having been "misplaced."
"For they are," he writes in the De Augm. (E. &amp; S. iv. p. 363)
"generally sought for in Physic, and not in Metaphysic. And yet if
it were but a fault in order I should not think so much of it; for
order is matter of illustration, but pertains not to the substance of
sciences. But this misplacing has caused a notable deficience, and
been a great misfortune to Philosophy. For the handling of final
causes in Physics has driven away and overthrown the diligent inquiry
of physical causes." ... "And I say this, not because those
final causes are not true and worthy to be inquired in metaphysical
speculations; but because their excursions and irruptions into the
limits of physical causes has bred a waste and solitude in that track.
For otherwise, if they be but kept within their proper bounds, men
are extremely deceived if they think there is any enmity or repugnancy
at all between the two." (Ibid. p. 364.) Bacon's meaning is
indeed clear enough to those who consider his examples. We do not
learn how clouds are produced by being told they serve for watering
the earth. It is no history of our earth itself, to say that its "solidness
is for the station and mansion of living creatures." "To know
the actual nature of a thing," observes an Oxford commentator on
the Organum, "we must investigate it in and for itself, not for its
results."<a name="FNanchor_61_80" id="FNanchor_61_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_80" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most curious facts relating to the "misplacement"
of Final Causes is that few more flagrant instances of that
abuse can be found than some which occur in the field, not of physical
but of moral science. The following remarkable example is from an
argument framed by Mr. James Mill against Sir J. Macintosh, which
appears all the more worthy of quotation, because it is reproduced
and approved by Mr. J. Stuart Mill. The whole argument deserves
perusal as showing how easily an acquired and customary kind of
association will sometimes predominate over free thought; but for
our present object a few passages will suffice. The italics are not
Mr. Mill's, but are here marked for the purpose of guiding the reader's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
eye to those steps which lead from <em>final cause</em> (or motive) to <em>interest</em>,
from interest to Utility in its grossest form, the artificial creation,
namely, of our spur to interested action, dignified by this author with
the sacred name of Morality, both in essence, <i>i.e.</i>, what makes an act
to be moral&mdash;and in respect of our moral sense, <i>i.e.</i>, what are the
sentiments with which we regard our own actions and those of other
persons.</p>

<p>"Men make classifications, as they do everything else, for some
end. Now, for what <em>end</em> was it that men, out of their innumerable
acts, selected a class, to which they gave the name of moral, and
another class, to which they gave the name of immoral? What was
the motive of this act? What its final cause?</p>

<p>"Assuredly the answer to this question is the first step, though Sir
James saw it not, towards the solution of his two questions, comprehending
the <em>whole</em> of ethical science; first, what <em>makes</em> an act to be
<em>moral?</em> and, secondly, what are the <em>sentiments</em> with which we <em>regard</em>
it?</p>

<p>"We may also be assured, that it was some very obvious <em>interest</em>
which recommended this classification; for it was performed, in a
certain rough way, in the <em>very rudest</em> states of society.</p>

<p>"Farther, we may easily see how, even in very rude states, men
were led to it, by little less than necessity.... They had
no stronger interest than to obtain the repetition of the one sort, and
to prevent the repetition of the other.... And here we
clearly perceive the origin of that important case of classification,
the classification of acts as <em>moral</em> and <em>immoral</em>. The acts, which it
was <em>important</em> to other men that each individual should <em>perform</em>, but
in which the individual had not a sufficient <em>interest</em> to secure the performance
of them, were constituted one class. The acts, which it was
<em>important</em> to other men that each individual should <em>abstain from</em>, but
in regard to which he had not a personal <em>interest</em> sufficiently strong to
secure his abstaining from them, were constituted another class. The
first class were distinguished by the name <em>moral</em> acts; the second by
the name <em>immoral</em>.</p>

<p>"The <em>interest</em> which men had in securing the performance of the
one set of acts, the non-performance of the other, led them by a sort
of necessity to think of the <em>means</em>. They had to <em>create</em> an interest,
which the actor would not otherwise have, in the performance of the
one sort, the non-performance of the other. And in proceeding to
this end, they could not easily miss their way. They had two powers
applicable to the purpose. They had a certain quantity of good at
their disposal, and they had a certain quantity of evil....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
And this is the scheme which they adopted; and which, in every
situation, they have invariably pursued. <em>The whole business of the
moral sentiments</em>, moral approbation, and disapprobation, has this for
its <em>object</em>,&mdash;the distribution of the good and evil we have at command,
for the <em>production</em> of acts of the <em>useful</em> sort, the <em>prevention</em> of acts of
the <em>contrary</em> sort. Can there be a nobler <em>object</em>?"<a name="FNanchor_62_81" id="FNanchor_62_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_81" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Some people may think that all nobleness is here taken away from
moral distinctions. Others may wonder how such refined calculation
could take place "in the very rudest states of Society." Many more
will feel that <em>this</em> factitious interest is <em>not</em> the moral sentiment of which
they are themselves conscious. We defer these points, however, to a
future chapter, and are satisfied now with calling attention to the
"misplacement" of final causes. To any modern versed (as Bacon
was) in the wisdom of the mediæval schools, the following parallel
might appear complete. Ask two questions&mdash;what are clouds?&mdash;what
are moral distinctions?&mdash;let a "why" be substituted for the "what."
Both are classified by men, both may be defined by their subserviency
to <em>human interests</em>,&mdash;it is sufficient to discover some use in each.
Moral distinctions exist for the benefit of society, clouds are for
watering the earth. An earth-watering contrivance describes not only
one use but the whole nature of a cloud; and for morality can a
nobler definition be found than that of a notion invented and named
on Utilitarian principles and promoting a public interest?<a name="FNanchor_63_82" id="FNanchor_63_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_82" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>less
morality does benefit mankind&mdash;doubtless clouds do water the
earth. But in either case is the good effect its full and comprehensive
"why?"&mdash;to say nothing of the desiderated "what?"</p>


<p>Francis Bacon (as we have seen) strongly affirmed that between
Physical Causes and Final Causes "kept within their proper bounds,
men are extremely deceived if they think there is any enmity or
repugnancy at all." The manner in which, according to the Baconian
doctrine, these two sets of causes harmonize and supplement each
other, so as conjointly to subserve the highest purpose of Natural
Theology, cannot be better explained than in the words of Bacon's late
lamented Editor, Mr. R. Leslie Ellis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is not sufficiently remarked that final causes have often been
spoken of without any reference to a benevolent intention. When it
is said that the final cause of a stone's falling is 'locus deorsum,' the
remark is at least but remotely connected with the doctrine of an
intelligent providence. We are to remember that Bacon has expressly
censured Aristotle for having made use of final causes without refer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>ring
to the fountain from which they flow, namely the providence of
the Creator. And in this censure he has found many to concur.</p>

<p>"Again, in any case in which the benevolent intention can be perceived,
we are at liberty to ask by what means and according to what
laws this benevolent intention is manifested and made efficient. If
this question is not to be asked, there is in the first place an end of
physical science, so far as relates to every case in which a benevolent
intention has been or can be recognised; and in the second, the argument
à posteriori founded on the contrivance displayed in the works
of creation is entirely taken away.</p>

<p>"This is, in effect, what Bacon says in the passage of the <i lang="la">De
Augmentis</i>, in which he complains of the abuse of final causes. If,
he affirms, the physical cause of any phenomenon can be assigned as
well as the final, so far is this from derogating from our idea of the
divine wisdom, that on the contrary it does but confirm and exalt it."<a name="FNanchor_64_83" id="FNanchor_64_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_83" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Before passing from this subject the reader's attention may be
drawn to two notes by the same eminent commentator. Bacon remarks
(Nov. Org. I. 48) that Final Causes are "ex naturâ hominis"
<i>i.e.</i>, have relation to the nature of Man. "It is difficult," writes Mr.
Ellis, "to assent to the assertion that the notion of the final cause,
considered generally, is more ex naturâ hominis than that of the
efficient. The subject is one of which it is difficult to speak accurately;
but it may be said that wherever we think that we recognise
a tendency towards a fulfilment or realisation of an idea, there the
notion of the final cause comes in. It can only be from inadvertence
that Professor Owen has set the doctrine of the final cause as it were
in antithesis to that of the unity of type: by the former he means
the doctrine that the suitability of an animal to its mode of life is the
one thing aimed at or intended in its structure. It cannot be doubted
that Aristotle would have recognised the preservation of the type as
not less truly a final cause than the preservation of the species or than
the well-being of the individual. The final cause connects itself with
what in the language of modern German philosophy is expressed by
the phrase 'the Idea in Nature.'"<a name="FNanchor_65_84" id="FNanchor_65_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_84" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The epigrammatic comparison of a Final Cause to a consecrated
Virgin<a name="FNanchor_66_85" id="FNanchor_66_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_85" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> has been reviewed by numberless disciples as well as critics
of our author. Mr. Ellis annotates the Latin text thus:&mdash;"<i lang="la">Nihil
parit</i>, means simply, <i lang="la">non parit opera</i>, which though it would have been
a more precise mode of expression would have destroyed the appo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>siteness
of the illustration. No one who fairly considers the context
can, I think, have any doubts as to the limitation with which the sentence
in question is to be taken. But it is often the misfortune of a
pointed saying to be quoted apart from any context, and consequently
to be misunderstood." And this seems to be a scholarly explanation.<a name="FNanchor_67_86" id="FNanchor_67_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_86" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>To complete the sketch of Baconian Metaphysic it appears only
needful to add that his respect for the science of Quantity is sufficient
to make him class under this higher philosophy&mdash;this near approach
to the apex of his Pyramid&mdash;the whole circle of Mathematics.</p>

<p>Our long note will not have been written in vain if the reader bears
its contents in mind when considering the abstract arguments advanced
throughout this Essay. It is well to see what very great authorities
have thought concerning the true use of Metaphysics;&mdash;it is well
also to see how they ought to be applied in questions of physical
science, and for the purpose of grounding a science of Natural
Theology.</p>


<h4><a id="B.2"></a>B.&mdash;ON THE PHRASE "DESIGN IMPLIES A DESIGNER."</h4>

<p>"It has been contended," says Professor Baden Powell, "that in
one sense it is mere tautology to say that Design implies a Designer."
(Connexion of Natural and Divine Truth, p. 183.)</p>

<p>As a matter of fact there can be no doubt that verbal-sounding
phrases, however useful in a system of Mnemonics, and much in
favour as political war-cries, always tend to discredit the sober course
of a philosophic argument. But Paley, though writing popularly,
did not intend a mere <i lang="la">ad captandum</i> effect, as may be seen by a
reference to his second chapter. He meant by Design and Contrivance
to express in brief the conditions he had laid down as
<em>characteristic</em> of the intentional adaptation of means to definitely
purposed ends,&mdash;with which conditions he appears to have been fully
satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>In his 23rd and 24th chapters, where some hasty writer might have
said "law implies a lawgiver," the Archdeacon prefers to state that
"a law pre-supposes an agent," and proceeds to argue the statement
on its merits. "Law," he says, "is only the mode according to which
an agent proceeds: it implies a power, for it is the order according
to which that power acts. Without this agent, without this power,
which are both distinct from itself, the 'law' does nothing; is
nothing." (Chapter 23.) He is well satisfied with this argument
also, and repeats it (slightly varied in form) during the course of his
next chapter.</p>

<p>In our comparison of Powell with Paley we were led to remark on
the diverse meanings of the word Design, and the facility with which
some authors have glided from one to another among its significations.
If any thinker believes that the examples he adduces are <em>distinctly</em>
instances of Foresight, Intention, and Will, he has the Designer full
in mind before he employs the term Design. But if his instances fall
short of thus much <em>implicit</em> force, the argument founded on them is a
worthless verbality.<a name="FNanchor_68_87" id="FNanchor_68_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_87" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Those who protest against the popular phrase, "Design proves a
Designer," say it is a temptation to assume this point&mdash;(the one point
at issue)&mdash;over which it skims with such secure ease. But to any
person in earnest, few things are more irritating than a piece of cool,
thorough-going assumption. It is like catching a cat and persistently
calling it a hare. Many visitors at certain Roman Hotels are aware
that when deprived of ears and tail <i lang="it">more Italico</i> and well roasted, the
resemblance between these two animals may give rise to questions of
disputed identity. Imagine, now, a party of cat-catchers, who not
only assume the Identity, but persevere in calling their mongrel curs
harehounds, and themselves huntsmen. No truer claim in reality do
a multitude of Design-hunters possess to any higher title than the
<i lang="it">leguleii</i> of Natural Theology. And the blame of their discredit must
in a great degree be laid upon their words. It is easy to say, "A
thrown-stone implies a thrower." But suppose the stone about
which you and I are talking was thrown by the fiery force of a
volcano? Must we hence infer the existence of a Cyclops or a Titan?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>This mode of popular speech reached the climax of absurdity when
it was gravely argued that "Evolution implies an Evolver." So it
might appear to the peculiar mind of the speaker; but how about
the mind of him who promulgated the evolution-hypothesis? Stones
(as we may observe) fly from more than one cause, and there is more
than one account to be given of the theory of Evolution.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show that the phrase commented on in
this note, prejudices the argument it is intended to assist. It wears
the appearance of embodying a foregone conclusion; and gives
trouble to the honest inquirer, who, in order to estimate reasonings
at their true value, must translate them into accurate forms of
speech.</p>

<p>We may aptly finish these remarks by a quotation from Whewell's
Aphorisms on the Language of Science. (Aphorism I., Philosophy of
the Inductive Sciences, II. 483.) "Words borrowed from common
language, and converted by scientific writers into technical terms,
have some advantages and some disadvantages. They possess this
great convenience, that they are understood after a very short
explanation, and retained in the memory without effort. On the
other hand they lead to some inconvenience; for since they have a
meaning in common language, a careless reader is prone to disregard
the technical limitation of this meaning, and to attempt to collect
their import in scientific books, in the same vague and conjectural
manner in which he collects the purpose of words in common cases.
Hence the language of science, when thus resembling common
language, is liable to be employed with an absence of that scientific
precision which alone gives it value. Popular writers and talkers,
when they speak of <em>force</em>, <em>momentum</em>, <em>action</em>, <em>and reaction</em>, and the
like, often afford examples of the inaccuracy thus arising from the
scientific appropriation of common terms."</p>

<p>A similar line of reflection led Coleridge to remark (Biog. Lit.,
Chap. x.) that "the language of the market would be in the schools
as <em>pedantic</em>, though it might not be reprobated by that name, as the
language of the schools in the market. The mere man of the world,
who insists that no other terms but such as occur in common conversation
should be employed in a scientific disquisition, and with no
greater precision, is as truly a <em>pedant</em> as the man of letters, who,
either over-rating the acquirements of his auditors, or misled by his
own familiarity with technical or scholastic terms, converses at the
wine-table with his mind fixed on his museum or laboratory." And
such pedantry is, we may add, not uncommonly just as perspicuous
as the definition which, says old Glanvill, "was lately given of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
<em>Thought</em> in a <em>University Sermon</em>&mdash;viz. <cite>A Repentine Prosiliency jumping
into Being</cite>." (<cite>Defence of the Vanity of Dogmatizing</cite>, Actio Decima, p.
61, ed. 1.)</p>


<h4><a id="C.2"></a>C.&mdash;HUME ON THE ANALOGIES OF ART AND NATURE.</h4>

<p class="center">[<i>Referred to in footnote (e) in the preceding Chapter.</i>]</p>

<p>The statement in the text is shaped as a not unfairly urged scientific
objection of the kind which might be raised by some actual craftsman
or producer. An objection identical in essence is thrown by Hume
into a refined semi-metaphysical shape, and made to turn upon our
general acquaintance with Human nature contrasted with our general
ignorance of the Divine. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The infinite difference of the subjects, replied he," (Hume's
dramatic Epicurus,) "is a sufficient foundation for this difference
in my conclusions. In works of <em>human</em> art and contrivance, it is
allowable to advance from the effect to the cause, and returning back
from the cause, to form new inferences concerning the effect, and
examine the alterations which it has probably undergone, or may still
undergo. But what is the foundation of this method of reasoning?
Plainly this; that man is a being, whom we know by experience,
whose motives and designs we are acquainted with, and whose
projects and inclinations have a certain connection and coherence,
according to the laws which nature has established for the government
of such a creature. When, therefore, we find that any work
has proceeded from the skill and industry of man; as we are otherwise
acquainted with the nature of the animal, we can draw a hundred
inferences concerning what may be expected from him; and these
inferences will all be founded in experience and observation. But
did we know man only from the single work or production which we
examine, it were impossible for us to argue in this manner; because
our knowledge of all the qualities, which we ascribe to him, being in
that case derived from the production, it is impossible they could
point to anything farther, or be the foundation of any new inference....</p>

<p>"The case is not the same with our reasonings from the works of
nature. The Deity is known to us only by his productions, and is a
single being in the universe, not comprehended under any species
or genus, from whose experienced attributes or qualities, we can, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
analogy, infer any attribute or quality in him." (Enquiry concerning
Human Understanding. Section xi.)</p>

<p>Hume himself gives in his own character a reply partially veiled
by the same half-metaphysical style which characterises the objection:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There occurs to me (continued I), with regard to your main
topic, a difficulty which I shall just propose to you without insisting
on it, lest it lead into reasonings of too nice and delicate a nature.
In a word, I much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be
known only by its effect (as you have all along supposed), or to be of
so singular and particular a nature, as to have no parallel and no
similarity with any other cause or object that has ever fallen under
our observation. It is only when two <em>species</em> of objects are found to
be constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other:
and were an effect presented which was entirely singular, and could
not be comprehended under any known <em>species</em>, I do not see, that we
could form any conjecture or inference at all concerning its cause.
If experience and observation and analogy be, indeed, the only guides
which we can reasonably follow in inferences of this nature; both the
effect and cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other
effects and causes which we know, and which we have found, in many
instances, to be conjoined with each other. I leave it to your own
reflection to pursue the consequences of this principle." (Ibid.)</p>

<p>The consequences which ought in fairness to be deduced may be
stated thus. The effect we contemplate, (<i>i.e.</i> Nature,) is <em>not</em> singular
but can be compared with other effects&mdash;those of Art. The comparison
is made in respect of certain specific attributes or properties
upon which the Design analogy turns, so that we may
reason upwards to certain specific analogies of Causation. Art
manifests the foreseeing attributes of the human artist, and from
comparison of these we infer in the Creator like attributes,&mdash;what
Hume elsewhere calls the <em>natural</em> attributes of the Deity. But this
likeness is properly termed <em>analogical</em>, because of the vast difference
in the magnitude of the effects <em>from</em> which we thus reason, and of the
causes <em>to</em> which we reason. As our wisdom and power are proportionable
to our earthly works, so are the Divine wisdom and power
proportionable to the whole majestic Universe. There is, then, a
comparison in <em>species</em>, but not in grandeur&mdash;the attributes are not
<em>similar</em>, but <em>analogical</em>. As the Heavens are high above the Earth,
so are His thoughts higher than our thoughts.</p>

<h4><a id="D.2"></a>D.&mdash;THE PANTHEISTIC CONSEQUENCES CHARGED UPON
PHYSICAL SPECULATIONS.</h4>

<p>The following is the passage from Professor Baden Powell referred
to in note (<i><a href="#h">h</a></i>) of the preceding chapter. Some short extracts were
also made from it on a previous page.</p>

<p>"Nothing but the common confused and mistaken notions as to
laws and causes, could give any colour to the assertion that ...
physical speculations tend to substitute general physical laws in the
place of the Deity; and that scientific statements of the conclusions
of Natural Theology are nothing but ill-disguised Pantheism.</p>

<p>"The utter futility of such inferences is at once seen, when the
smallest attention is given to the plain distinctions above laid down
between 'moral' and 'physical' causation; and to the proper force
of the conclusions from natural science establishing the former by
means of the latter.</p>

<p>"This distinction obviously points to the <em>very reverse</em> of the assertion
that physical action is identical with its moral cause; the
essential difference and contrast between them is the very point
which the whole argument upholds and enforces.</p>

<p>"Of all forms of philosophical mysticism, the idea of Pantheism
seems to me one of the most extravagant. Ever-present <em>mind</em> is a
direct inference from the universal order of nature, or rather only
another mode of expressing it. But of the <em>mode</em> of existence of that
mind we can infer nothing.</p>

<p>"To assert, then, that this universally manifested mind is <em>co-existent</em>,
or even to be <em>identified</em>, with <em>matter</em>, is at best a mere
gratuitous hypothesis, and as such wholly unphilosophical in itself,
and leading to many preposterous consequences. But if further
supposed to apply in any higher sense as to an object of worship,
trust, love, obedience, or the like (as is implied in the term Pan<em>theism</em>),
it appears to involve moral contradictions of the most startling
kind.</p>

<p>"There are, however, many who, though rejecting Pantheism as
<em>untrue</em>, do not conceive it <em>absurd</em> or <em>contradictory</em>. Much, however,
will, in all such cases, depend on the precise <em>sense</em> in which it is
maintained. With some it seems to have been upheld on a fanciful
analogy with the conception of the human frame animated by an
indwelling spirit; as if in a somewhat similar manner the supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
mind might animate nature. Without disputing this in a certain
sense, the cases surely cannot be considered at all parallel: we do
not infer the existence of the human mind, from the arrangement and
adaptation of the bodily organs, nor is it the moral cause of their
organisation.</p>

<p>"If Pantheism were asserted merely in the sense of a kind of vital
or animating principle pervading the material world, I would admit
that such an idea involves <em>no absurdity</em>, or <em>contradiction</em>, but still I
should regard it as visionary and unphilosophical. I could but class
it with the 'vital forces' which Kepler fancied necessary for keeping
up the motions of the planets, with the 'plastic powers of nature,'
'her abhorrence of a vacuum,' and the like chimæras. But it is
when men elevate such a supposed animating principle into a <em>Deity</em>,
a being of supreme wisdom, power, beneficence, and goodness, yet
residing in every atom of matter, and <em>participating directly</em> in every
form and case of material action, that the contradiction arises."
<cite>Spirit of the Inductive Philosophy</cite>, pp. 176-9.</p>


<h4><a id="E.2"></a>E.&mdash;THE EXTENT AND DIVISIONS OF THE SCIENCE OF
NATURAL THEOLOGY.</h4>

<p>The following passages from Professor Powell's Essay "on the
Spirit of the Inductive Philosophy" will go far to justify the praise
and blame bestowed upon his mode of procedure in the text of the
foregoing chapter. But we would recommend his own pages to the
student's discriminative perusal.</p>

<p>In extract No. 1, Baden Powell shows with equal truth and force
that universal Law must be contemplated as a manifestation of one
supreme Intelligence presiding over the whole Universe. A
philosopher who looks on Nature with this majestic breadth of view
does not need for his own deepest convictions to follow Design
through a multitude of smaller evidences.</p>

<p>If extract No. 2 could be admitted as a <em>full</em> account of the conditions
and limitations of Natural Theology, our science would seem to
result in an obscuration of the magnificently Supreme Power already
accepted. So far as its <em>letter</em> goes, the Creator of the Universe might
appear to be shut out from the world which He has made. We
cannot (as has been said) consent to this narrow consideration of
Natural Theology, nor yet of Powell's meaning.</p>

<p>Extract No. 3 acknowledges what all physical investigators ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to acknowledge,&mdash;that although their sciences contribute very much
towards solving the problem of the Universe, and although their
results readily harmonize with the solution maintained by the Theist&mdash;yet
there rests over that vast problem a cloud which the physical
sciences cannot completely dispel. This (as we shall see in Chapter
V.) is indeed the confession of the greatest minds at present engaged
upon the philosophy of Natural Science.</p>

<p><em>Extract</em> No. 1.&mdash;"From the inductive philosophy we derive our
belief in the harmony, order, and uniformity of natural causes, perpetually
maintained in a universally connected chain of dependence.
And hence it is, that we arrive at those sublime ideas of a presiding
Intelligence of which <em>law</em> and <em>uniformity</em>, universal mechanism once
for all adjusted, are the proper <em>external manifestations</em>.</p>

<p>"To the truly inductive philosopher, <em>fate</em> and <em>chance</em>, <em>necessity</em> and
<em>accident</em>, are words without meaning. To him, the world is made up
of recondite combinations of physical laws, and the existence and
maintenance of those laws are the very indication of a Supreme Mind.
But chance is irreconcilable with laws, fate with mind, regulated and
fixed order with blind destiny, fortuitous accident, or arbitrary interruption.</p>

<p>"All rational natural theology advances by tracing the immediate
mechanical steps and particular processes in detail, and the physical
causes in which the influences of the Great Moral Cause or Supreme
Mind are manifested. The greater the number and extent of such
secondary steps and intermediate processes through which we can
trace it, the greater the complexity and wider the ramifications of the
chain of causes, the more powerful and convincing the instruction
they convey as to the existence and operation of the Divine wisdom
and power.</p>

<p>"Yet it is a common mode of illustration to speak of the <em>chain</em> of
secondary causes reaching up to the First Cause. Or, again, fears
are entertained of tracing secondary causes too far, so as to intrench
on the supremacy of the First Cause. But this is an erroneous
analogy: the maker or designer of a chain is no more at one end of
it than at the other. The length of the chain in no way alters our
conviction of its skilful structure, except to enhance it. If the
number of links were truly <em>infinite</em>, so much the more infinite the
skill of its framer.</p>

<p>"Mr. F. Newman observes,<a name="FNanchor_69_88" id="FNanchor_69_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_88" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> I think most truly, that the <em>common</em>
arguments from what are called 'secondary causes' to the 'First
Cause' are unsatisfactory: and I would trace this to the confused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
sense in which those terms are commonly used, as already explained;
and which, I think, might be entirely removed by attention to the distinctions
above laid down. While, on the other hand, I fully acknowledge
that those arguments, when correctly understood, lead only to
a <em>very limited</em> conclusion; and one which falls infinitely <em>short</em> of those
high moral and spiritual intuitions on which Mr. F. Newman grounds
his religious system, yet in no way discredits or supersedes them."
<em>Essay</em>, pp. 151-4.</p>

<p><em>Extract</em> No. 2.&mdash;"In the present state of knowledge, law and
order, physical causation and uniformity of action, are the elevated
manifestations of Divinity, creation and providence. Interruptions
of such order (if for a moment they could be admitted as such)
could only produce a sort of temporary concealment of such manifestations,
and involve the beautiful light shed over the natural world in
a passing cloud. We do not indeed <em>doubt</em> that the sun exists behind
the cloud, but we certainly do not see it; still less can we call the
obscuration a special <em>proof</em> of its presence. The main point in the
system of order and law is its absolute <em>universality</em>. Exceptions, if
real, must <i lang="la">pro tanto</i> imply a deficiency in the chain of connexion,
and might, to a sceptical disposition, offer a ground of doubt.</p>

<p>"But so overwhelming is the mass and body of proof, that no
philosophic mind would allow such exceptions for a moment to weigh
against it; they would be as dust in the balance. A supreme moral
cause manifested through law, order, and physical causes, is the
confession of science: conflicting operations, arbitrary interruptions,
abrupt discontinuities, are the idols of ignorance, and, if they really
prevailed, would so far be to the philosopher only the exponents of
chaos and atheism; the obscuration (as far as they extend) of the
sensible manifestation of the Supreme Intelligence." <cite>Ibid.</cite> 165, 6.</p>

<p><em>Extract</em> No. 3.&mdash;"The whole tenor of the preceding argument is
directed to show that the inference and assertion of a <em>Supreme Moral
Cause</em>, distinct from and above nature, results immediately from the
recognition of the eternal and universal maintenance of the order of
<em>physical causes</em>, which are its essential <em>external manifestations</em>.</p>

<p>"Of the <em>mode of action or operation</em> by which the Supreme Moral
Cause influences the universal order of physical causes, <em>we confess our
utter ignorance</em>. But the <em>evidence</em> of such operation, where nature
exists, can never be lost or interrupted. And in proportion as our
more extended researches exhibit these indications more fully and
more gloriously displayed, we cannot but believe that our contemplations
are more nearly and truly approaching their <span class="smcap">Source</span>." <cite>Ibid.</cite> 179.</p>

<p>The reader will not grudge the time he may have bestowed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
this note if it leads him to a distinct apprehension of the true breadth
and compass of our science.</p>

<p>"Natural Theology," says Kant, "infers the attributes and the
existence of an author of the world, from the constitution of, the order
and unity observable in this world, in which two modes of Causality,
together with their laws, must be accepted&mdash;that is to say, Nature
and Freedom. Thus Natural Theology rises from this world to a
supreme Intelligence, whether as to the principle of all natural or of
all moral order and perfection. In the former case it is termed
Physico-Theology, in the latter Ethical or Moral Theology." This
last term he explains by adding, "Not theological ethics; for this
latter science contains ethical laws, which <em>presuppose</em> the existence of
a Supreme Governor of the world; while Moral Theology, on the
contrary, is an evidence of the existence of a Supreme Being, an
evidence founded upon ethical laws." <cite>Kant's Kritik der reinen Vernunft
Transscendental Elementarlehre</cite>, s. 7.</p>

<p>It was from the fulness and depth of a personal conviction on this
topic that the present writer ventured to assert in 1870 that "The
conditions under which Natural Theology becomes scientifically
possible, are found when it supplements Natural Science by a science
of Right and Wrong," and also that "for the future Natural Theology
ought to follow this path and no other&mdash;unless it wishes to commit
suicide." These assertions were made in a University Sermon<a name="FNanchor_70_89" id="FNanchor_70_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_89" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> on
the question, "Under what Conditions is a Science of Natural
Theology possible?" and they were censured as novel and unprecedented
by critics who ought to have known better.</p>


<h4><a id="F.2"></a>F.&mdash;ON TELEOLOGY.</h4>

<p>One consequence of the principle on which this Essay has been
framed is an endeavour to place before the reader's eye different modes
of reasoning in the language of their several authors. The method of
looking at any subject-matter in a diversity of lights naturally leads to
copiousness of quotation. There can, it is evident, be no varieties of
thought so undeniably distinct as those which are the actual products
of diverse minds.</p>

<p>The maxim which has governed the following selection is what
Bacon would call a marshalling Idea. They posit one central thought
and throw light upon it from a circle of separate reflectors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Let it be observed that such a collection of opinions implies no
appeal to authority in the narrow sense of the word. There is indeed
a manifest distinction between authority and authorities&mdash;and our
present appeal is to the latter. No man's <i lang="la">ipse dixit</i> can dogmatically
settle questions which belong to an inquirer's responsible self; but it
is surely the wisdom of every one who acknowledges the awful sense
of accountability attendant on the determination of questions affecting
his central beliefs, to weigh the reasonings of others who have felt the
same deep impression of their paramount importance. If any one is
reluctant so to do from an idea that by doing thus much he pays a
wrongful deference to prejudices, he has in truth assumed the whole
issue which he is bound to examine. How otherwise can he certainly
allege that the prejudice is not inherent within himself?</p>

<p>Reluctance of this kind would on the present occasion be thoroughly
misplaced. Authorities as here quoted are neither more nor less than
the opinions of experts who have a title to be heard each in his own
proper department. Throughout the practical conduct of life we all
experience the benefit of laying aside our private spectacles from time
to time and of looking through the glasses of other men. And in
questions such as the one now before us, is it possible to do better
than try whether we can see for ourselves what has been pronounced
discernible by men who contemplated this world of ours with more
than ordinary powers of vision?</p>

<p>The present writer has a personal interest in bringing together the
reflections of many who have reached the same resting-place along
various lines of approach, and who have expressed their conclusions
with some diversity of language. He has ventured himself on viewing
the evidences of Natural Theology from a position by no means
identical with that most commonly occupied by Natural Theologians.
The student, therefore, who takes a wide survey of the
field will be the critic best prepared to examine the latter part of
this Essay.</p>

<p>The first authority quoted among our ample citations is Hume,
whose appearance as a witness for Natural Theology may surprise
some readers. As, however, is remarked by an eminent writer in the
<cite>Quarterly</cite>, Hume's hard common sense "enabled him when he liked,
to control the excesses of a speculative imagination and subject it to
practical reason, as he understood reason's verdict." He even went
so far as to say that "The whole frame of Nature bespeaks an Intelligent
Author; and no rational inquirer can, after serious reflection,
suspend his belief a moment with regard to the primary principles of
genuine Theism and Religion." (<cite>Natural History of Religion</cite>, Intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>duction.)
Indeed, according to Cucheval Clarigny,<a name="FNanchor_71_90" id="FNanchor_71_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_90" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Hume was an
"almost Christian" at certain periods of his life. The repellant forces
that kept him back, are "not far to seek."</p>

<p>The following passages refer to the illative analogy which forms the
proper shape of the argument from Design.</p>

<p>"That the works of Nature bear a great analogy to the productions
of art, is evident; and according to all the rules of good reasoning,
we ought to infer, if we argue at all concerning them, that their causes
have a proportional analogy. But as there are also considerable
differences, we have reason to suppose a proportional difference in the
causes; and in particular ought to attribute a much higher degree of
power and energy to the supreme cause than any we have ever observed
in mankind. Here then the existence of a DEITY is plainly
ascertained by reason: and if we make it a question whether, on
account of these analogies, we can properly call him a <em>mind</em> or <em>intelligence</em>,
notwithstanding the vast difference which may reasonably be
supposed between him and human minds; what is this but a mere
verbal controversy? No man can deny the analogies between the
effects: To restrain ourselves from inquiring concerning the causes, is
scarcely possible: From this inquiry, the legitimate conclusion is, that
the causes have also an analogy: And if we are not contented with calling
the first and supreme cause a GOD or DEITY, but desire to vary
the expression; what can we call him but MIND or THOUGHT, to
which he is justly supposed to bear a considerable resemblance?" <cite>Dialogues
concerning Natural Religion</cite>, Part xii. in Essays, Vol. II. p. 526.<a name="FNanchor_72_91" id="FNanchor_72_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_91" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>"If the whole of Natural Theology, as some people seem to maintain,
resolves itself into one simple, though somewhat ambiguous, at
least undefined proposition, <em>That the cause or causes of order in the
universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence</em>. If
this proposition be not capable of extension, variation, or more particular
explication; if it affords no inference that affects human life, or
can be the source of any action or forbearance; and if the analogy,
imperfect as it is, can be carried no farther than to the human intelligence,
and cannot be transferred, with any appearance of probability,
to the other qualities of the mind: If this really be the case, what
can the most inquisitive, contemplative, and religious man do more
than give a plain, philosophical assent to the proposition, as often as
it occurs; and believe that the arguments on which it is established,
exceed the objections which lie against it?" <cite>Ibid.</cite> p. 538.</p>

<p>The following is the opinion of Cleanthes, upon whom Hume confers
the palm in the dialogue;&mdash;"Take care, Philo, replied Cleanthes;
take care; push not matters too far: allow not your zeal against false
religion to undermine your veneration for the true. Forfeit not this
principle, the chief, the only great comfort in life; and our principal
support amidst all the attacks of adverse fortune. The most agreeable
reflection, which it is possible for human imagination to suggest,
is that of genuine Theism, which represents us as the workmanship of
a Being perfectly good, wise, and powerful; who created us for happiness;
and who, having implanted in us immeasurable desires of good,
will prolong our existence to all eternity, and will transfer us into an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
infinite variety of scenes, in order to satisfy those desires, and render
our felicity complete and durable. Next to such a Being himself (if
the comparison be allowed), the happiest lot which we can imagine, is
that of being under his guardianship and protection." <cite>Ibid.</cite> p.535.<a name="FNanchor_73_92" id="FNanchor_73_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_92" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The next three extracts give Hume's opinion on the prevailing
principle disclosed by the analogy&mdash;design, purpose, and the recognition
of final causes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Though the stupidity of men, barbarous and uninstructed, be so
great, that they may not see a sovereign author in the more obvious
works of nature, to which they are so much familiarized; yet it
scarce seems possible, that any one of good understanding should reject
that idea, when once it is suggested to him. A purpose, an intention,
a design is evident in everything; and when our comprehension
is so far enlarged as to contemplate the first rise of this visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
system, we must adopt, with the strongest conviction, the idea of
some intelligent cause or author. The uniform maxims, too, which
prevail throughout the whole frame of the universe, naturally, if not
necessarily, lead us to conceive this intelligence as single and
undivided, where the prejudices of education oppose not so reasonable
a theory. Even the contrarieties of nature, by discovering themselves
everywhere, become proofs of some consistent plan, and
establish one single purpose or intention, however inexplicable and
incomprehensible." <cite>Natural History of Religion</cite> XV.&mdash;General Corollary,
in <cite>Essays</cite> II. pp. 422, 3.</p>

<p>"In many views of the universe, and of its parts, particularly the
latter, the beauty and fitness of final causes strike us with such
irresistible force that all objections appear (what I believe they really
are) mere cavils and sophisms; nor can we then imagine how it was
ever possible for us to repose any weight on them." <cite>Dialogues concerning
Natural Religion</cite>, Part X. in <cite>Essays</cite>, II. 509.</p>

<p>"The order and arrangement of nature, the curious adjustment of
final causes, the plain use and intention of every part and organ;
all these bespeak in the clearest language an intelligent cause or
author. The heavens and the earth join in the same testimony.
The whole chorus of nature raises one hymn to the praises of its
Creator.... I have found a Deity; and here I stop my
enquiry. Let those go farther who are wiser or more enterprising."
<cite>Ibid.</cite> Part IV. p. 467.</p>

<p>Hume is conspicuous amongst reasoners on Natural Theology for
having distinctly comprehended Human Nature along with Nature
in the cycle of its evidences. "This sentence at least," he writes,
"Reason will venture to pronounce, That a mental world, or
universe of ideas, requires a cause as much as does a material world,
or universe of objects; and, if similar in its arrangement, must require
a similar cause. For what is there in this subject which should
occasion a different conclusion or inference? In an abstract view,
they are entirely alike; and no difficulty attends the one supposition
which is not common to both of them." <cite>Ibid.</cite> Part IV. p. 464.</p>

<p>This statement brings us to the impediments which withheld
Hume from forming a sublime idea of the Divine Being, such an idea
as kindles the enthusiasm of devout men, and inspires even timidly
sensitive souls with deathless confidence in the final triumph of a
self-sacrificing virtue destined to survive the grave. These causes
were the opinions he maintained respecting human nature. We may
lay it down as a universal rule that every one who sees the animal,
but not the heaven-aspiring moral element in his own nature, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
our common nature, will fail to represent to himself the lineaments or
reflection of the Divine attributes. An acknowledged kinship with
brutal passions, the lowering of society and wedlock to animal gregariousness,
of moral principle and the rule of Right and Wrong to a
perception of Utility, are fatal hindrances in the search after God;&mdash;a
search arduous to the best of us, since deep as the far translucent
heavens, are the majestic thoughts of Him after Whom we strive to
feel. Now Hume failed to discern the Godlike in Man. "Human
life," he remarks in his <cite>Sceptic</cite>, "is more governed by fortune than
by reason; is to be regarded more as a dull pastime than as a serious
occupation; and is more influenced by particular humour than by
general principles." Morality is no fixed star in Hume's firmament.
To omit the laxity of many moral maxims he lays down, the very
nature and foundations of morality were imperilled by his analytics.<a name="FNanchor_74_93" id="FNanchor_74_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_93" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>"He has," writes Mackintosh, "altogether omitted the circumstance
on which depends the difference of our sentiments regarding moral
and intellectual qualities. We <em>admire</em> intellectual excellence, but we
bestow no moral <em>approbation</em> on it." And again&mdash;"He entirely overlooks
that consciousness of the <em>rightful supremacy of the moral
faculty</em> over every other principle of human action, without an explanation
of which, ethical theory is wanting in one of its vital organs."
<cite>Ethical Philosophy</cite>, pp. 182, 4. "If," says Hume in the <cite>Sceptic</cite>,
"we can depend upon any principle which we learn from philosophy,
this, I think, may be considered as certain and undoubted, that there
is nothing in itself valuable or despicable, desirable or hateful, beautiful
or deformed; but that these attributes arise from the particular constitution
and fabric of human sentiment and affection." And half a dozen
pages afterwards&mdash;"Good and ill, both natural and moral, are entirely
relative to human sentiment and affection." So too, "The necessity
of justice to the support of society is," he tells us, "the <span class="smcap">Sole</span>
foundation of that virtue;" usefulness, he explains, "is the <span class="smcap">Sole</span>
source of the moral approbation paid to fidelity, justice, veracity,
integrity, and those other estimable and useful qualities and principles."
It is also "the source of a considerable part of the merit ascribed
to humanity, benevolence, friendship, public spirit, and other social
virtues of that stamp." <cite>Principles of Morals</cite>, Sect. III. <i>sub fin.</i>
With these sentiments it is not surprising that while he insists on the
analogy between human workmanship and the natural universe he
cannot argue analogically from moral Truth to the Divine attributes&mdash;and
even goes so far as to decide that the first causes of the Universe
"have neither goodness nor malice."</p>

<p>The student of Natural Theology cannot direct his attention too
soon or too steadily to the vast share possessed by our moral senti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>ments
in our apprehension of the Divine nature. It is from our
sense of Responsibility attached to each act of Will and Choice that we
deduce the idea of causation. It is from our intuitions of immutable
moral truth and the irreconcilable antithesis between Right and
Wrong that we behold the Martyr as one who has not lived in vain,
but lives truly and for ever; and are sure that there exists a God who
has regard to the righteous, the oppressed, the fatherless, and the
widow. Clear moral insight appears in Socrates, who chose to die
rather than offend against the eternal laws. But ought the man to be
styled moral or immoral who should balance together two comparative
utilities,&mdash;that of preserving his father's life and that of acquiring by
a judicious neglect, without risk to himself, a property which he resolved
to expend usefully? Of one thing we may be sure, God could
not be in all his thoughts whilst making such a calculation.</p>

<p>It is thus that a pure Morality and an elevated conception of the
Divine Being act and react upon each other. And in this way our
speculative and practical Reason become interlaced&mdash;the former giving
to the logical understanding an account of those ideas which form the
essential sublimity and moving influence of our practical beliefs&mdash;the
springs of our daily and hourly behaviour. There is no more certain
characteristic of a mind so ordered than its ability to deal with a
moral doubt which casuists might long debate, to solve the enigma
within the compass of a moment's thought, and to defend the
solution by fair and honest argument. As regards our present
question it makes no difference by what means such a condition of
mind may have been brought about, but it is plain that a sense of
accountability has much to do with this condition. And the connexion
between Responsibility and our belief in a life immortal, and
in a just and veracious God, will form a subject for future consideration.</p>

<p>Meantime, the reader must take Hume's acceptance of the doctrine
of final causes and the Design-analogy, for what it is worth. No
candid person ought to condemn Hume as he has often been condemned
without remembering the allowance to be made for his
excessive vanity,<a name="FNanchor_75_94" id="FNanchor_75_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_94" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> his extreme love of paradoxical speculation, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
dramatic irony which runs throughout his writings. These are in
fact some of the qualities which make him an unfit schoolmaster for
the young, and a shrewd exercise for elder men. One useful lesson
we gather just now is learned from the fact that he places a wide gulf
between the natural and moral attributes of the Deity, and draws a
veil over the latter, because the alleged poverty of our moral ideas
precludes any analogy to reason upon, however remote that analogy
may appear. Hence Hume's God of Nature becomes a shadow like
Wordsworth's Laodamia, scarce fit for the Elysian bowers; He is no
longer felt by us to be the God of Human Nature.</p>

<p>We cannot here omit to observe that Hume had no thought of
worshipping the Order of the World, or of erecting a temple to
immutable Laws, blind Force, or any other blank impersonal Necessity.
The limit of his inquiry was what to human reason might
appear the easiest and most probable interpretation of nature.<a name="FNanchor_76_95" id="FNanchor_76_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_95" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> This
question he asked and answered. Whether modern science has added
important data on which to found a more conclusive reply is a further
inquiry which we shall have to consider, but meantime it appears
certain that <em>if</em> the most sceptical theory of the most sceptical scientist
were held true, there would still remain the same necessity for asking
Hume's question. For neither our life, nor the world we live in, nor
the wide universe, have any real cause or aim scientifically assigned
them. We should still have to inquire by what agency and to what
purpose we and the All exist? That we really <em>are</em> is a fact for you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
O reader, and for me; and we cannot but want to discover <em>whether</em>
we shall yet <em>be</em>, when this brief yet tedious life is done; and if so,
whether our present acts and choosings must influence our Hereafter?
Science has said nothing to annihilate our interest concerning these
topics, nor yet to finally decide them.</p>

<p>For the truth of what is contained in this last paragraph, we may
cite as witness amongst scientific men, the distinguished President of
the British Association for 1872. Dr. Carpenter spoke at Brighton in
these words:&mdash;"There is a great deal of what I cannot but regard as
fallacious and misleading Philosophy&mdash;'oppositions of Science falsely
so called'&mdash;abroad in the world at the present time. And I hope to
satisfy you, that those who set up <em>their own conceptions</em> of the Orderly
Sequence which they discern in the Phenomena of Nature, as fixed
and determinate <em>Laws</em>, by which those phenomena not only <em>are</em>
within all Human experience, but always <em>have been</em>, and always <em>must
be</em>, invariably governed, are really guilty of the Intellectual arrogance
they condemn in the Systems of the Ancients, and place themselves
in diametrical antagonism to those real Philosophers, by whose comprehensive
grasp and penetrating insight that Order has been so far
disclosed." And again towards the close of his Address:&mdash;"With the
growth of the Scientific Study of Nature, the conception of its
Harmony and Unity gained ever-increasing strength. And so among
the most enlightened of the Greek and Roman Philosophers, we find
a distinct recognition of the idea of the Unity of the Directing Mind
from which the Order of Nature proceeds; for they obviously believed
that, as our modern Poet has expressed it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"All are but parts of one stupendous whole,</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Whose body Nature is, and God the Soul."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>The Science of Modern times, however, has taken a more special
direction. Fixing its attention exclusively on the <em>Order</em> of Nature, it
has separated itself wholly from Theology, whose function it is to seek
after its <em>Cause</em>. In this, Science is fully justified, alike by the entire
independence of its objects, and by the historical fact that it has been
continually hampered and impeded in its search for the Truth as it is
in Nature, by the restraints which Theologians have attempted to
impose upon its inquiries. But when Science, passing beyond its
own limits, assumes to take the place of Theology, and sets up its
own conception of the <em>Order</em> of Nature as a sufficient account of its
<em>Cause</em>, it is invading a province of Thought to which it has no claim,
and not unreasonably provokes the hostility of those who ought to be
its best friends."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Our next extract is from Sir Benjamin Brodie, and it, too, considers
the absolute permanence of the laws of Nature in relation to
Design:&mdash;</p>

<p>Crites. "There have been sceptics who have believed that the
laws of nature were, if I may use the expression, self-existent; and
that what we now see around us is but a continuation of a system that
has been going on from all eternity&mdash;thus dispensing with the notion
of a great creative Intelligence altogether."</p>

<p>Eubulus. "Under any view of the subject, it seems to me that it
would be very difficult, if not impossible, for any of us practically to
separate the marks of design, and of the adaptation of means to ends,
which the universe affords, but which are more especially conspicuous
in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, from the notion of an intelligent
Cause. There is not one of the sceptics to whom you have
alluded, who would not, if he were asked the question, "What is the
use of the eye?" answer, "that it is intended to be the organ of vision,
as the ear is intended to be that of hearing, and as the nostrils are
constructed for the purpose of smell." But what I said just now
requires some further explanation. When I stated that at the present
time there is no evidence of any deviation from certain established
laws of nature&mdash;that if we could thoroughly know and thoroughly
appreciate what those laws really are, we should be able to account
for all the phenomena around us&mdash;I was far from intending to say
that there has never been a period when other laws than those which
are now in force were in operation, or that the time may not arrive
when the present order of things will be in a similar manner superseded.
Looking at the structure of the globe, and the changes in its
surface which have been disclosed to the observation of geologists, we
recognize the probability that there was a time when this planet of
ours was no better than a huge aërolite, and in a state quite incompatible
with animal or even vegetable life. The existence of living
beings, then, must have had a beginning; yet we have no evidence of
any law now in force which will account for this marvellous creation."<a name="FNanchor_77_96" id="FNanchor_77_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_96" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Psychological Inquiries, Part II., pp. 193-4-5.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>The great surgeon next discusses the question of "Equivocal
Generation" now known by the terms Archebiosis and Abiogenesis.
His opinion, together with some later information on the topic, will be
found in our additional notes to Chapter III.</p>

<p>When writing his first series of "Inquiries" Sir Benjamin recorded
his judgment regarding our knowledge and conception of the Divine
Existence and in terms which show how closely he connected the
general subject of Mind and its Essence with his idea of the Creator.</p>

<p>Eubulus. "When I contemplate the evidence of intention and
design which present themselves everywhere around us, but which,
to our limited comprehensions, is more especially manifested in the
vegetable and animal creations, I cannot avoid attributing the construction
and order of the universe to an intelligent being, whose
power and knowledge are such that it is impossible for me to form
any adequate conception of them, any more than I can avoid referring
the motions of the planets and stars to the same law of gravitation as
that which directs the motions of our own globe. But no one, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
apprehend, will maintain that the mind of the Deity depends on a
certain construction of brain and nerves; and Dr. Priestley, the most
philosophical of the advocates of the system of materialism, ventures
no further than to say that we have no knowledge on the subject.
But, to use the words of Sir Isaac Newton, 'This powerful ever-living
agent being in all places, is more able to move the bodies within his
boundless uniform sensorium, and thereby to form and reform the
parts of the universe, than we are, by our will, to move the parts of our
own bodies.' The remainder of the passage from which I have made
this quotation, is not without interest, as indicating the view which
Newton took of the matter in question:&mdash;'And yet we are not to
consider the world as the body of God, or the several parts thereof
as the parts of God. He is an uniform being, void of organs,
members, or parts, and they are his creatures, subordinate to him,
and subservient to him, and he is no more the soul of them than the
soul of man is the soul of the species carried through the organs of
sense into the place of its sensation, where it perceives them by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
immediate presence, without the intervention of any third thing. The
organs of sense are not for enabling the soul to perceive the species
of things in its sensorium, but only for conveying them thither; and
God has no need of any such organs, he being everywhere present to
the things themselves.'"</p>

<p>Ergates. "I entirely agree with you in the opinion that we
must admit the existence of the Deity as a fact as well established
as that of the law of gravitation, and that in doing so we must
further admit that mind may and does exist, independently of bodily
organization. Be it also remembered that <em>mind</em>, in its humblest
form, is still <em>mind</em>, and that, immeasurable as the distance between
them may be, it must nevertheless be regarded as being of the same
essence with that of the Deity himself. For my own part I find
no difficulty in conceiving the existence of mind independently of
corporeal organs." (p. 39, seq.)</p>

<p>Those who have read Professor Huxley's article on the Metaphysics
of Sensation,<a name="FNanchor_78_97" id="FNanchor_78_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_97" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> will feel much interested in the passages selected
from Newton by Sir Benjamin. It seems almost a pity that the
accomplished Professor did not cite any of Dr. Clarke's explanatory
remarks addressed to Leibniz respecting Sir Isaac Newton's expressions.
The similitude above quoted, Clarke explains thus:&mdash;"Mr.
Newton considère le cerveau et les organes des sens, comme le
moyen par lequel ces images sont Formées et non comme le moyen
par lequel l'âme voit ou aperçoit ces images, lorsqu'elles sont ainsi
formées. Et dans l'Univers, il ne considère pas les choses, comme
si elles étaient des images formées par un certain moyen ou par des
organes; mais comme des choses réelles, que Dieu lui-même a
formées, et qu'il voit dans tous les lieux où elles sont, sans l'intervention
d'aucun moyen. C'est tout ce que Mr. Newton a voulu dire
par la comparaison, dont il s'est servi, lorsqu'il suppose que l'Espace
infini est, pour ainsi dire, le Sensorium de l'Etre qui est présent
partout."</p>

<p>A simpler way of putting the case may be to point out that the
comparison of a Sensorium is intended, like other similitudes we
have reviewed, to hold in only one point. Newton uses it apparently
to localize the idea of <em>immediate intuition</em>. In this way all Space,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the whole Universe, with its moving contents, which transcend the
farthest flight of human imagination are,&mdash;not distantly,&mdash;but immediately
present to the mind of God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Passing from these thoughts which may illustrate, but cannot
explain, a subject dark with excess of splendour, we now enter on a
series of extracts so chosen as to furnish an ample examination of
the several <em>ideas</em> involved in the philosophy of Design, and an estimate
of their several values. It is evidently important that the
reader should possess some means of forming clear conceptions
respecting the nature of these ideas, and the collection now appended,
aims at saving him the trouble of a tedious search. Any points
which may have appeared perplexing or obscure in the preceding
Chapter will, it is hoped, be made sufficiently plain by a perusal of
the following pages.</p>

<p>The first in this class of passages is taken from Whewell's Philosophy
of the Inductive Sciences. No one probably was ever much
better fitted by training and attainment than that eminent writer for
the investigation he here undertakes. We must, however, caution
the reader against supposing that Dr. Whewell means to introduce
him into a world of Platonism. The ideas he speaks of may be
illustrated in this way. Suppose a person constructs a right line
according to Euclid's definition and draws it evenly between its
extreme points, his mind has immediately an impression of rightness
or straightness, which he attaches to all lines actually so constructed
or conceived of as theoretically possible. This idea of straightness
is absolute and universal. So, again, looking at two such lines, he
knows that they, cannot, in the nature of things inclose a space, and
this idea likewise is universal and absolutely true.</p>

<p>With the nature of these ideas as a psychological question, the
reader need not concern himself for our present purpose. It is
sufficient to observe they are brought into activity by a practical
occasion. Whether they were wholly or partially pre-existent&mdash;or
whether they represent a state of our Reason evoked by the occasion&mdash;are
points which make no difference to their exact strength of
validity. We find as a matter of fact in going through life that this
particular class of ideas is so very true that it enables us to gauge the
material universe. Yet notably enough, Hume in his Treatise (I.
247, seq.) reduces applied mathematics to a species of probability.</p>

<p>Other ideas having various degrees of validity and practical necessity
are involved in the diverse processes which pertain to the
inductive sciences. Dr. Whewell's work was written for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
of elucidating them, which he does at great length. To some such
ideas, principles, and beliefs we shall advert by and bye.</p>

<p>All that seems now necessary is to remark that the distinguished
author's general division (Book IX.) where our extract will be found,
is concerned with the Philosophy of Biology, and that the paragraphs
quoted are sections of its chapter VI., "On the Idea of Final Causes."</p>

<p>"1. By an examination of those notions which enter into all our
reasonings and judgments on living things, it appears that we conceive
animal life as a vortex or cycle of moving matter in which the form
of the vortex determines the motions, and these motions again support
the form of the vortex: the stationary parts circulate the fluids, and
the fluids nourish the permanent parts. Each portion ministers to
the others, each depends upon the other. The parts make up the
whole, but the existence of the whole is essential to the preservation
of the parts. But parts existing under such conditions are <em>organs</em>,
and the whole is <em>organized</em>. This is the fundamental conception of
organization. 'Organized beings,' says the physiologist,<a name="FNanchor_79_98" id="FNanchor_79_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_98" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> 'are composed
of a number of essential and mutually dependent parts.'&mdash;'An
organized product of nature,' says the great metaphysician,<a name="FNanchor_80_99" id="FNanchor_80_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_99" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
'is that in which all the parts are mutually ends and means.'</p>

<p>"2. It will be observed that we do not content ourselves with
saying that in such a whole, all the parts are <em>mutually dependent</em>.
This might be true even of a mechanical structure; it would be
easy to imagine a framework in which each part should be necessary
to the support of each of the others; for example, an arch of
several stones. But in such a structure the parts have no properties
which they derive from the whole. They are beams or stones when
separate; they are no more when joined. But the same is not the
case in an organized whole. The limb of an animal separated from
the body, loses the properties of a limb and soon ceases to retain
even its form.</p>

<p>"3. Nor do we content ourselves with saying that the parts are
<em>mutually causes and effects</em>. This is the case in machinery. In a
clock, the pendulum by means of the escapement causes the descent
of the weight, the weight by the same escapement keeps up the
motion of the pendulum. But things of this kind may happen by
accident. Stones slide from a rock down the side of a hill and cause
it to be smooth; the smoothness of the slope causes stones still to
slide. Yet no one would call such a slide an organized system.
The system is organized, when the effects which take place among
the parts are <em>essential to our conception of the whole</em>; when the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
would not <em>be</em> a whole, nor the parts, parts, except these effects were
produced; when the effects not only happen in fact, but are included
in the idea of the object; when they are not only seen, but foreseen;
not only expected, but intended: in short when, instead of
being causes and effects, they are <em>ends</em> and <em>means</em>, as they are termed
in the above definition.</p>

<p>"Thus we necessarily include, in our idea of Organization, the
notion of an End, a Purpose, a Design; or, to use another phrase
which has been peculiarly appropriated in this case, a <em>Final Cause</em>.
This idea of a Final Cause is an essential condition in order to the
pursuing our researches respecting organized bodies....</p>

<p>"5. This has already been confirmed by reference to fact; in the
History of Physiology, I have shown that those who studied the
structure of animals were irresistibly led to the conviction that the
parts of this structure have each its end or purpose;&mdash;that each
member and organ not merely produces a certain effect or answers a
certain use, but is so framed as to impress us with the persuasion that
it was constructed <em>for</em> that use;&mdash;that it was <em>intended</em> to produce the
effect. It was there seen that this persuasion was repeatedly expressed
in the most emphatic manner by Galen;&mdash;that it directed the
researches and led to the discoveries of Harvey;&mdash;that it has always
been dwelt upon as a favourite contemplation, and followed as a certain
guide, by the best anatomists;&mdash;and that it is inculcated by the
physiologists of the profoundest views and most extensive knowledge
of our own time. All these persons have deemed it a most certain
and important principle of physiology, that in every organized structure,
plant or animal, each intelligible part has its allotted office:&mdash;each
organ is designed for its appropriate function:&mdash;that nature, in
these cases, produces nothing in vain: that, in short, each portion of
the whole arrangement has its <em>final cause</em>; an end to which it is
adapted, and in this end, the reason that it is where and what it is.</p>

<p>"6. This Notion of Design in organized bodies must, I say, be
supplied by the student of organization out of his own mind: a truth
which will become clearer if we attend to the most conspicuous and
acknowledged instances of <em>design</em>. The structure of the eye, in which
the parts are curiously adjusted so as to produce a distinct image on
the retina, as in an optical instrument;&mdash;the trochlear muscle of the
eye, in which the tendon passes round a support and turns back, like
a rope round a pulley;&mdash;the prospective contrivances for the preservation
of animals, provided long before they are wanted, as the milk
of the mother, the teeth of the child, the eyes and the lungs of the
f&oelig;tus:&mdash;these arrangements, and innumerable others, call up in us a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
persuasion that Design has entered into the plan of animal form and
progress. And if we bring in our minds this conception of Design,
nothing can more fully square with and fit it, than such instances as
these. But if we did not already possess the Idea of Design;&mdash;if we
had not had our notion of mechanical contrivance awakened by inspection
of optical instruments, or pulleys, or in some other way;&mdash;if we
had never been conscious ourselves of providing for the future;&mdash;if
this were the case, we could not recognize contrivance and prospectiveness
in such instances as we have referred to. The facts are,
indeed, admirably in accordance with these conceptions, when the
two are brought together: but the facts and the conceptions come
together from different quarters&mdash;from without and from within.</p>

<p>"7. We may further illustrate this point by referring to the
relations of travellers who tell us that when consummate examples of
human mechanical contrivance have been set before savages, they
have appeared incapable of apprehending them as proofs of design.
This shows that in such cases the Idea of Design had not been
developed in the minds of the people who were thus unintelligent:
but it no more proves that such an idea does not naturally and
necessarily arise, in the progress of men's minds, than the confused
manner in which the same savages apprehend the relations of space,
or number, or cause, proves that these ideas do not naturally belong
to their intellects. All men have these ideas; and it is because they
cannot help referring their sensations to such ideas, that they apprehend
the world as existing in time and space, and as a series of causes
and effects. It would be very erroneous to say that the belief of
such truths is obtained by logical reasoning from facts. And in like
manner we cannot logically deduce design from the contemplation of
organic structures; although it is impossible for us, when the facts
are clearly before us, not to find a reference to design operating in
our minds."</p>

<p>It seems well to add here the practical comments made by Müller
and Kant on the passages quoted from them by Dr. Whewell in his
first Paragraph. Professor Müller writes thus (Baly's translation,
Vol. I., p. 19):&mdash;"The manner in which their elements are combined,
is not the only difference between organic and inorganic bodies; there
is in living organic matter a principle constantly in action, the operations
of which are in accordance with a rational plan, so that the
individual parts which it creates in the body, are adapted to the
design of the whole; and this it is which distinguishes organism.
Kant says, 'The cause of the particular mode of existence of each
part of a living body resides in the whole, while in dead masses each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
part contains this cause within itself.' This explains why a mere
part separated from an organized whole generally does not continue
to live; why, in fact, an organized body appears to be one and
indivisible."</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the great Metaphysician, it may be interesting
to place in connection with this extract from Müller, certain views
of other distinguished physiologists. Sir C. Bell states his own
opinions on the connection of Life and Organization in this manner
(<cite>Appendix to Paley's Natural Theology</cite> by Sir Charles Bell, commencing
with pp. 211-13):&mdash;"Archdeacon Paley has, in these two
introductory chapters, given us the advantage of simple, but forcible
language, with extreme ingenuity, in illustration. But for his example,
we should have felt some hesitation in making so close a
comparison between design, as exhibited by the Creator in the animal
structure, and the mere mechanism, the operose and imperfect contrivances
of human art.</p>

<p>"Certainly, there may be a comparison; for a superficial and
rapid survey of the animal body may convey the notion of an
apparatus of levers, pulleys, and ropes&mdash;which maybe compared with
the spring, barrel, and fusee, the wheels and pinions, of a watch.
But if we study the texture of animal bodies more curiously, and
especially if we compare animals with each other&mdash;for example, the
simple structure of the lower creatures with the complicated structure
of those higher in the scale of existence&mdash;we shall see, that in the
lowest links of the chain animals are so simple, that we should almost
call them homogeneous; and yet in these we find life, sensibility,
and motion. It is in the animals higher in the scale that we discover
parts having distinct endowments, and exhibiting complex mechanical
relations. The mechanical contrivances which are so obvious in man,
for instance, are the provisions for the agency and dominion of an
intellectual power over the materials around him.</p>

<p>"We mark this early, because there are authors who, looking upon
this complexity of mechanism, confound it with the presence of life
itself, and think it a necessary adjunct&mdash;nay, even that life proceeds
from it: whereas the mechanism which we have to examine in the
animal body is formed with reference to the necessity of acting upon
or receiving impressions from, things external to the body&mdash;a
necessary condition of our state of existence in a material world.</p>

<p>"Many have expressed their opinion very boldly on the necessary
relation between organization and life, who have never extended
their views to the system of nature. To place man, an intelligent
and active being, in this world of matter, he must have properties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
bearing relation to that matter. The existence of matter implies an
agency of certain forces;&mdash;the particles of bodies must suffer attraction
and repulsion; and the bodies formed by the balance of these
influences upon their atoms or particles must have weight or gravity,
and possess mechanical properties. So must the living body, independently
of its peculiar endowments, have similar composition and
qualities, and have certain relations to the solids, fluids, gases, heat,
light, electricity, or galvanism, which are around it. "Without these,
the intellectual principle could receive no impulse&mdash;could have no
agency and no relation to the material world. The whole body must
gravitate or have weight; without which it could neither stand
securely, nor exert its powers on the bodies around it. But for this,
muscular power itself, and all the appliances which are related to that
power, would be useless. When, therefore, it is affirmed that
organization or construction is necessary to life, we may at least
pause in giving assent, under the certainty that we see another and a
different reason for the construction of the body. Thus we perceive,
that as the body must have weight to have power, so must it have
mechanical contrivance, or arrangement of its parts. As it must have
weight, so must it be sustained by a skeleton; and when we examine
the bones, which give the body height and shape, we find each
column (for in that sense a bone may be first taken) adjusted with
the finest attention to the perpendicular weight that it has to bear, as
well as to the lateral thrusts to which it is subject in the motions of
the body."... Again p. 405, seq.</p>

<p> ... "Mr. Hunter illustrated the subject thus:&mdash;Death is
apparent or real. A man dragged out of the water, and to appearance
dead, is, notwithstanding, alive, according to the definition we have
given. The living endowments of the individual parts are not exhausted.
The sensibility may be yet roused; the nerves which
convey the impression may yet so far retain their property, that other
motor nerves may be influenced through them; the muscles may be
once more concatenated, and drawn into a simultaneous action. That
vibratory motion which we have just said may be witnessed in a
muscle recently cut out of the body, may be so excited in a class of
muscles&mdash;for example, in the muscles of inspiration&mdash;that the apparently
dead draws an inspiration. Here is the first of a series of vital
motions which excites the others, and the heart beats, and the blood
circulates, and the sensibilities are restored; and the mind, which was
in the condition of one asleep, is roused into activity and volition,
and all the common phenomena of life are resuscitated. Such is the
series of phenomena which is presented in apparent death from suffo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>cation;
but, if the death has been from an injury of some vital part,
the sensibilities and properties of action in the rest of the body,
though resident for a time, have lost their relations, and there is a
link wanting in that chain of vital actions which restores animation.
Here, then, there can be no resuscitation; and the death of the
individual parts of the body rapidly succeeds the apparent death of
the body.</p>

<p>"We perceive now that our original conception of life and the
terms we use respecting it, in common parlance, are but ill-adapted
to this subject when philosophically considered. We early associate
life and motion so intimately that the one stands for the other. If we
then investigate by anatomy, we find a curious and minute mechanism
in operation, an engine and tubes for circulation, and, in short, an
internal motion of every particle of the frame; and the anatomist is
also led into the error of associating in his mind life with motion and
organization. But when we consider the subject more closely, and
divest ourselves of habits and prejudices associated with words, we
perceive that, without making any vain and even dangerous attempt
at definition, life is first to be contemplated as the peculiarity distinguishing
one of two classes into which all matter must be arranged;
the one class, which embraces all living matter, is subject to a controlling
influence which resists the chemical agents, and produces a
series of revolutions, in an order and at periods prescribed; the other,
dead matter, is subject to lapse and change under chemical agency
and the common laws of matter.</p>

<p>"Let us examine the body of a perfect or a complicated animal.
We find each organ possessed of a different power. But there is as
yet no conventional language adapted to our discourse on this subject,
and that is the source of many mistakes; for when a man even like
Mr. Hunter had his mind illuminated upon this science, how was he
to frame his language, when every word that he used had already a
meaning which had no reference to the discovery he had made&mdash;to
the distinct qualities which he had ascertained to belong to the living
parts?...</p>

<p>"The difference between dead and living matter will appear to be,
that in the one instance the particles are permanently arranged and
continue to exhibit their proper character, as we term it, until by
ingenuity and practice some means are found to withdraw the
arranging or uniting influence; and then the matter is chemically
dissolved: resolves into its elements, and forms new combinations:
whilst the life continues, not simply to arrange the particles, and to
give them the order or organization of the animal body, but to whirl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
them in a series of revolutions, during all which the material is
passive, the law being in the life. The order and succession of these
changes and their duration do not result from the material of the
frame, which is the same in all animals, but from that influence
which we term life, and which is superadded to the material."
(<cite>Ibid.</cite> 408.)</p>

<p>Writing on Function Mr. Herbert Spencer discusses the following
question. Its interest to our argument is unmistakable.</p>

<p>"Does Structure originate Function, or does Function originate
Structure? is a question about which there has been disagreement.
Using the word Function in its widest signification, as the totality of
all vital actions, the question amounts to this&mdash;Does Life produce
Organization, or does Organization produce Life?</p>

<p>"To answer this question is not easy, since we habitually find the
two so associated that neither seems possible without the other; and
they appear uniformly to increase and decrease together.... There
is, however, one fact implying that Function must be regarded as
taking precedence of Structure. Of the lowest Rhizopods, which
present no distinctions of parts, and nevertheless feed and grow and
move about, Prof. Huxley has remarked that they exhibit Life without
Organization....</p>

<p>"It may be argued that on the hypothesis of Evolution, Life necessarily
comes before organization. On this hypothesis, organic matter
in a state of homogeneous aggregation, must precede organic matter
in a state of heterogeneous aggregation. But since the passing from
a structureless state to a structured state, is itself a vital process, it
follows that vital activity must have existed while there was yet no
structure: structure could not else arise. That function takes precedence
of structure, seems also implied in the definition of Life. If
Life consists of inner actions so adjusted as to balance outer actions&mdash;if
the actions are the <em>substance</em> of Life, while the adjustment of
them constitutes its <em>form</em>; then, may we not say that the actions to
be formed must come before that which forms them&mdash;that the continuous
change which is the basis of function, must come before the
structure which brings function into shape? Or again, since throughout
all phases of Life up to the highest, every advance is the effecting
of some better adjustment of inner to outer actions; and since the
accompanying new complexity of structure is simply a means of
making possible this better adjustment; it follows that function is
from beginning to end the determining cause of structure."&mdash;<cite>Principles
of Biology</cite>, by Mr. Herbert Spencer, p. 153, seq.</p>

<p>We now return to Kant, from whom Dr. Whewell quoted the sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>tence&mdash;"An
organized product of nature is that in which all the
parts are mutually ends and means." Passing by a metaphysical
paragraph expressed in a manner too technical for the general reader,
Kant's practical comment on this sentence runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dass die Zergliederer der Gewächse und Thiere, um ihre Structur
zu erforschen und die Gründe einsehen zu können, warum und zu
welchem Ende solche Theile, warum eine solche Lage und Verbindung
der Theile und gerade diese innere Form ihnen gegeben worden, jene
Maxime: dass nichts in einem solchen Geschöpf <span class="smcap">UMSONST</span> sey, als
unumgänglich nothwendig annehmen und sie eben so, als den
Grundsatz der allgemeinen Naturlehre: dass <span class="smcap">Nichts von ungefähr</span>
geschehe, geltend machen, ist bekannt. In der That können sie sich
auch von diesem teleologischen Grundsatze eben so wenig lossagen,
als dem allgemeinen physischen, weil, so wie bei Veranlassung des
letzteren gar keine Erfahrung überhaupt, so bei der des ersteren
Grundsatzes kein Leitfaden für die Beobachtung einer Art von
Naturdinge, die wir einmal teleologisch unter dem Begriffe der Naturzwecke
gedacht haben, übrig bleiben würde.</p>

<p>"Denn dieser Begriff führt die Vernunft in eine ganz andere
Ordnung der Dinge, als die eines blossen Mechanism der Natur, der
uns hier nicht mehr genug thun will. Eine Idee soll der Möglichkeit
des Naturproducts zum Grunde liegen. Weil diese aber ein absolute
Einheit der Vorstellung ist, statt dessen die Materie eine Vielheit der
Dinge ist, die für sich keine bestimmte Einheit der Zusammensetzung
an die Hand geben kann, so muss, wenn jene Einheit der Idee, sogar
als Bestimmungsgrund <i lang="la">a priori</i> eines Naturgesetzes der Causalität
einer solchen Form des Zusammengesetzten dienen soll, der Zweck
der Natur auf ALLES, was in ihrem Producte liegt, erstreckt werden;
weil, wenn wir einmal dergleichen Wirkung im <span class="smcap">Ganzen</span> auf einen
übersinnlichen Bestimmungsgrund über den blinden Mechanism der
Natur hinaus beziehen, wir sie auch ganz nach diesem Princip
beurtheilen müssen und kein Grund da ist, die Form eines solchen
Dinges noch zum Theil vom letzteren als abhängig anzunehmen, da
alsdann bei der Vermischung ungleichartiger Principien, gar keine
sichere Regel der Beurtheilung übrig bleiben würde." <cite>Kritik der
Urtheilskraft</cite>, Section 65.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who find Kant's German difficult we
subjoin a neat French Translation from the pen of M. Barni.</p>

<p>"On sait que ceux qui dissèquent les plantes et les animaux pour
en étudier la structure, et pouvoir reconnaître pourquoi et à quelle
fin telles parties leur ont été données, pourquoi telle disposition et
tel arrangement des parties, et précisément cette forme intérieure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
admettent comme indispensablement nécessaire cette maxime que rien
n'existe <em>en vain</em> dans ces créatures, et lui accordent une valeur égale
à celle de ce principe de la physique générale, que <em>rien n'arrive par
hasard</em>. Et en effet ils ne peuvent pas plus rejeter ce principe téléologique
que le principe universel de la physique; car, de même
qu'en l'absence de ce dernier il n'y aurait plus d'expérience possible
en général, de même, sans le premier, il n'y aurait plus de fil conducteur
pour l'observation d'une espèce de choses de la nature, que
nous avons une fois conçues téléologiquement sous le concept des
fins de la nature.</p>

<p>"En effet ce concept introduit la raison dans un tout autre ordre
de choses que celui du pur mécanisme de la nature, qui ne peut plus
ici nous satisfaire. Il faut qu'une idée serve de principe à la possibilité
de la production de la nature. Mais comme une idée est une
unité absolue de réprésentation, tandis que la matière est une pluralité
de choses qui par elle-même ne peut fournir aucune unité déterminée
de composition, si cette unité de l'idée doit servir, comme principe <i lang="la">a
priori</i>, à déterminer une loi naturelle à la production d'une forme de
ce genre, il faut que la fin de la nature s'étende <em>à tout</em> ce qui est
contenu dans sa production. En effet, dès que pour expliquer un
certain effet, nous cherchons, au-dessus de l'aveugle mécanisme de la
nature, un principe supra-sensible et que nous l'y rapportons <em>en général</em>,
nous devons le juger tout entier d'après ce principe; et il n'y a pas
de raison pour regarder la forme de cette chose comme dépendant
encore en partie de l'autre principe, car alors, dans le mélange de principes
hétérogènes, il ne resterait plus de règle sûre pour le jugement."
<cite>Critique du Jugement</cite>, Section 65.</p>

<p>Kant is not in any dress the easiest of thinkers to follow&mdash;a result
possibly consequent upon the resemblance which his writings bear to
trains of reasoning as they pass from the lips of one who thinks
aloud. The following paragraph from another work of Dr. Whewell's
may be useful to some minds as a comment upon this portion of
Kant's teleology.</p>

<p>"There is yet one other Idea which I shall mention, though it is
one about which difficulties have been raised, since the consideration
of such difficulties may be instructive: the Idea of a purpose, or as
it is often termed, a <em>Final Cause</em>, in organized bodies. It has been
held, and rightly, that the assumption of a Final Cause of each part
of animals and plants is as inevitable as the assumption of an efficient
cause of every event. The maxim, that in organized bodies nothing
is <em>in vain</em>, is as necessarily true as the maxim that nothing happens
<em>by chance</em>. I have elsewhere shown fully that this Idea is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
deduced from any special facts, but is assumed as a law governing
all facts in organic nature, directing the researches and interpreting
the observations of physiologists. I have also remarked that it is
not at variance with that other law, that plants and that animals are
constructed upon general plans, of which plans, it may be, we do
not see the necessity, though we see how wide is their generality.
This Idea of a purpose,&mdash;of a Final Cause,&mdash;then, thus supplied by
our minds, is found to be applicable throughout the organic world.
It is in virtue of this Idea that we conceive animals and plants as
subject to <em>disease</em>; for disease takes place when the parts do not fully
answer their <em>purpose</em>; when they do not do what they <em>ought</em> to do.
How is it then that we thus find an Idea which is <em>supplied</em> by our
own minds, but which is <em>exemplified</em> in every part of the organic
world? Here perhaps the answer will be readily allowed. It is
because this Idea is an Idea of the Divine Mind. There <em>is</em> a Final
Cause in the constitution of these parts of the universe, and therefore
we can interpret them by means of the Idea of Final Cause. We
can <em>see</em> a purpose, because there <em>is</em> a purpose. Is it too presumptuous
to suppose that we can thus enter into the Ends and Purposes of the
Divine Mind? We willingly grant and declare that it would be
presumptuous to suppose that we can enter into them to any but
a very small degree. They doubtless go immeasurably beyond our
mode of understanding or conceiving them. But to a certain extent
we <em>can</em> go. We can go so far as to see that they <em>are</em> Ends and
Purposes. It is <em>not</em> a vain presumption in us to suppose that we
know that the eye was made for seeing and the ear for hearing. In
this the most pious of men see nothing impious: the most cautious
philosophers see nothing rash. And that we can see thus far into the
designs of the Divine Mind, arises, we hold, from this:&mdash;that we
have an Idea of Design and of Purpose which, so far as it is merely
<em>that</em>, is true; and so far, is Design and Purpose in the same sense in
the one case and in the other."<a name="FNanchor_81_100" id="FNanchor_81_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_100" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be well worth while to close this present series of illustrations
by a review of Professor Huxley's last published and best
considered positions on Teleology. He printed, in 1871, an article on
Haeckel's "Natürliche Schöpfungs Geschichte," and has now entitled
it "The Genealogy of Animals," and included it in his recent volume
of Critiques. We may therefore assume that we here find the distinguished
Biologist's deliberate opinions. He says, p. 305, "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Teleology which supposes that the eye, such as we see it in man or
one of the higher <i>Vertebrata</i>,<a name="FNanchor_82_101" id="FNanchor_82_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_101" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> was made with the precise structure
which it exhibits, for the purpose of enabling the animal which
possesses it to see, has undoubtedly received its death-blow. Nevertheless
it is necessary to remember that there is a wider Teleology,
which is not touched by the doctrine of Evolution, but is actually
based upon the fundamental proposition of Evolution. That proposition
is, that the whole world, living and not living, is the result of
the mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the forces
possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity of the
universe was composed. If this be true, it is no less certain that the
existing world lay, potentially, in the cosmic vapour; and that a
sufficient intelligence could, from a knowledge of the properties of the
molecules of that vapour, have predicted, say the state of the Fauna
of Britain in 1869, with as much certainty as one can say what will
happen to the vapour of the breath on a cold winter's day.</p>

<p>"Consider a kitchen clock, which ticks loudly, shows the hours,
minutes, and seconds, strikes, cries 'cuckoo!' and perhaps shows
the phases of the moon. When the clock is wound up, all the
phenomena which it exhibits are potentially contained in its mechanism,
and a clever clockmaker could predict all it will do after an
examination of its structure.</p>

<p>"If the evolution theory is correct, the molecular structure of the
cosmic gas stands in the same relation to the phenomena of the world
as the structure of the clock to its phenomena."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxley's comparisons<a name="FNanchor_83_102" id="FNanchor_83_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_102" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> are always amusing, partly because
they are of an unlooked for description. They also keep up the
attention of his readers or hearers. But they have one great fault&mdash;the
fault we noticed in explaining the nature of analogical argument&mdash;they
carry away the mind too far, and lead the reader often, sometimes
the writer himself, into very serious oversights. Let us take
notice how the Professor carries out his present similitude. "Now
let us suppose a death-watch, living in the clock-case, to be a learned
and intelligent student of its works. He might say, 'I find here
nothing but matter and force and pure mechanism from beginning to
end,' and he would be quite right. But if he drew the conclusion
that the clock was not contrived for a purpose, he would be quite
wrong. On the other hand, imagine another death-watch of a
different turn of mind. He, listening to the monotonous 'tick! tick!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
so exactly like his own, might arrive at the conclusion that the clock
was itself a monstrous sort of death-watch, and that its final cause
and purpose was to tick. How easy to point to the clear relation of
the whole mechanism to the pendulum, to the fact that the one thing
the clock did always and without intermission was to tick, and that all
the rest of its phenomena were intermittent and subordinate to
ticking! For all this, it is certain that kitchen clocks are not contrived
for the purpose of making a ticking noise.</p>

<p>"Thus the teleological theorist would be as wrong as the mechanical
theorist, among our death-watches; and, probably, the only
death-watch who would be right would be the one who should maintain
that the sole thing death-watches could be sure about was the
nature of the clock-works and the way they move; and that the
purpose of the clock lay wholly beyond the purview of beetle
faculties.</p>

<p>"Substitute 'cosmic vapour' for 'clock,' and 'molecules' for
'works,' and the application of the argument is obvious." (pp. 306, 7.)</p>

<p>One thing is very obvious here&mdash;and that is a flaw. State the case
as a proposition thus&mdash;One or both of the two beetles is to the clock
and its maker, as man is to the world and its Maker. A tremendous
assumption&mdash;surely as sufficient to have startled Francis Bacon as the
apparition of a new Idol. Is there any possible reason for elevating
a death-watch&mdash;thinking in character as a death-watch&mdash;into a
capable interpreter of clocks? Moreover, the ground principle of our
human Teleology is that Man holds a lofty relation, not to the Universe
only, but to its Maker likewise. He claims, in a word, the most
sublime of all earthly kinships. The very fact that he can look with
intelligent and admiring appreciation upon the works of God, justifies
his belief that he has a real insight into their excellence, and is so
far at least akin to the mind of God. If Mr. Huxley meant that a
proportionate degree of insight into clock-making was possessed by
his beetles, they would surely have been able to read the clock's dial-plate
and understand the lesson conveyed by its pointers. The
death-watch would at least say "<i lang="la">labuntur horæ</i>"&mdash;and comprehend
that time was being registered&mdash;although he might even then fall far
short of our human belief "<i lang="la">pereunt et imputantur</i>," and fail of
knowing that time registers itself in a record of moral good and evil.</p>

<p>The truth is that all mixing up manlike attributes with brute
animality, and what seems ten times worse, with machines of wood
and metal, can be nothing better than an attempt to produce a sound
and prolific offspring from some ill-assorted and heterogeneous
hybridism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>We have adverted to this peculiarity of style before and venture
upon doing so again, because all admirers of Mr. Huxley's great
powers (and who can read his writings without such admiration?)
may surely be justified in wishing that he would discard it at once
and for ever. Its practical effect is apparently to assume the real
point at issue and to cover up the tacit assumption. That he is
really no chance offender in this respect may be gathered from a few
instances noted at random. We have just had a couple of philosophic
death-watches<a name="FNanchor_84_103" id="FNanchor_84_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_103" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>&mdash;one a Teleologist, the other a Mechanicist&mdash;the
lucubrations of both being neither exactly human, nor yet Coleopterous.
We observed before a righteous clock<a name="FNanchor_85_104" id="FNanchor_85_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_104" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>&mdash;regularly moral if
regularly wound up. He has besides a machine, undescribed but
endued with a gift of ratiocination<a name="FNanchor_86_105" id="FNanchor_86_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_105" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>&mdash;and more curious still a piano<a name="FNanchor_87_106" id="FNanchor_87_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_106" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
which listens when it is played upon, and though possessed of only
one sense (hearing) succeeds in building up "endless ideas" of a
certain cast and cogency. From this self-educated instrument much
may of course be looked for, and accordingly we find</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Its cogitative faculties immersed</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">In cogibundity of cogitation,"</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>till it evolves from the depth of its consciousness something like an
idealistic theory of sound. This hypothesis, Mr. Huxley in reply to
his piano, refutes, first by an appeal to the material substance of the
instrument itself; and secondly to the existence of a musician who
plays upon it. Will he permit us to accept in like manner the fact
of our own nobler subsistence, and also the being of One Who attunes
its secret heart-strings to notes of sublime melody?</p>

<p>The monsters aforecited irresistibly remind us of a repartee of
Goldsmith's. He wittily said that Dr. Johnson would make little
fishes talk like great whales. Had they done so it may be doubted
whether the Doctor's idolatrous biographer would have discovered a
minnowy mind beneath their Johnsonian utterances. And we confess
to a difficulty of our own. The righteous clock is indeed genuinely
Huxleian, but what shall we say of his mechanical logic, his piano,
and his death-watches? By way of illustrating our perplexity let us
suppose some rural sexton to mix up his own instincts with those of
a biological burying beetle. The destiny of all flesh would naturally
be determined in the first place by a decent covering of earth. But
what about its final end? Would that be an aldermanic beetle feast
or a <i lang="la">Resurgam</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Think again how a member of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals might breathe a benevolent spirit into a much
employed dissecting knife. The sharp thing would certainly entertain
a repugnance to the horrors of vivisection. There might also be a
denial of its utility based on the scalpel's personal experience, or
perhaps a moral doubt as to whether such means are justified by the
ends proposed. Would Mr. Huxley listen to the remonstrance and
undertake to lift up his powerful voice at Paris or at Berlin besides a
few other remote places which need not be particularized?</p>

<p>Or finally what ear would he lend to a magnifying glass accustomed
to habits of observation and possessed by the soul of Spurzheim.
Suppose it should affirm that a slice of Destructiveness is recognizably
different in structure from a section of Benevolence; and Acquisitiveness
in like manner distinguishable from Ideality! Yet a humanitarian
scalpel or Spurzheim magnifying glass may be thought a
Huxleian phenomenon.</p>

<p>A truce to such mongrel meditations. We gladly turn away from
them and continue our quotations from the Professor's sentiments
delivered <i lang="la">in propria persona</i>, recommencing at the place where our
last extract broke off. (p. 307.)</p>

<p>"The teleological and the mechanical views of nature, are not
necessarily, mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the more purely
a mechanist the speculator is, the more firmly does he assume primordial
molecular arrangement, of which all the phenomena of the
universe are the consequences; and the more completely is he thereby
at the mercy of the teleologist who can always defy him to disprove
that this primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to
evolve the phenomena of the universe."</p>

<p>We quite agree with Mr. Huxley that Mechanism never can exclude
final causes, and that a thorough-going theory of Evolution (taken
apart from its excrescences) disables the theorist from all real disproof
of intention or Design. As we said before, the question of how the
theorist's primordial arrangement began, is left unprovided for. And
if a beginning, so certainly an <em>end</em>. The more steadily the first state
of the Universe conceivable by Science is contemplated, the wider
and more determinate the view thus taken, the more evident it
becomes that the ground occupied by Natural Theology is not fenced
off by the iron pale of Mechanism. The fencer is (as Huxley says)
"at the mercy of the Teleologist."</p>

<p>The Professor's next sentence deserves careful consideration&mdash;"On
the other hand, if the teleologists assert that this, that, or the other
result of the working of any part of the mechanism of the universe is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
its purpose and final cause, the mechanist can always inquire how he
knows that it is more than an unessential incident&mdash;the mere ticking
of the clock, which he mistakes for its function."</p>

<p>How far this criticism holds good of many well-meant treatises filled
with special instances of Design is a question for candid consideration.
Meantime the whole sentence amounts to this conclusion:&mdash;We
must distinguish between such wide arguments as Baden Powell's,
and the details of certain writers who have dealt with what they
thought good examples and illustrations of a grand universal principle.
And that such is Mr. Huxley's meaning we may perceive from
another paragraph immediately preceding our first extract. (p. 305.)</p>

<p>"In more than one place, Professor Haeckel enlarges upon the
service which the <cite>Origin of Species</cite> has done, in favouring what he
terms the 'causal or mechanical' view of living nature as opposed to
the 'teleological or vitalistic' view. And no doubt it is quite true
that the doctrine of Evolution is the most formidable opponent of all
the commoner and coarser forms of Teleology. But perhaps the most
remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology rendered by Mr.
Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and Morphology, and the
explanation of the facts of both which his views offer."</p>

<p>Now, such being the state of facts, we may refuse to say with
Huxley that the following question (asked p. 307) is "not irrational."
"Why trouble oneself about matters which are out of reach, when
the working of the mechanism itself, which is of infinite practical
importance, affords scope for all our energies?"</p>

<p>We cannot forego our trouble, for two reasons. <em>First</em>, according
to the statements before quoted, Mr. Darwin's researches have
improved the case for Teleology. Advocates of Design may therefore
take courage, they have gained a potent alliance. <em>Secondly</em>, "the
practical working of the Mechanism itself" is very far, we think,
from being our All&mdash;so far, indeed, that it sinks into insignificance
compared with the hope of Immortality. Our highest interest lies in
gathering such information as we can regarding Him with Whom we
have to do as the Arbiter of our future existence. Above all things,
we desire Him to be our Father and our Friend. Perchance His
attributes are not matters out of reach. He may be very near to
every one of us, if we are indeed His Offspring.</p>

<p>Another opinion of Professor Huxley's is of great auxiliary value
to the argument from Design. The structures mentioned have to
some minds appeared as its most serious difficulties. "Professor
Haeckel," he explains, "has invented a new and convenient name,
'Dysteleology,' for the study of the 'purposelessnesses' which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
observable in living organisms&mdash;such as the multitudinous cases of
rudimentary and apparently useless structures. I confess, however,
that it has often appeared to me that the facts of Dysteleology cut
two ways. If we are to assume, as evolutionists in general do, that
useless organs atrophy, such cases as the existence of lateral rudiments
of toes, in the foot of a horse, place us in a dilemma. For,
either these rudiments are of no use to the animal, in which case,
considering that the horse has existed in its present form since the
Pliocene epoch, they surely ought to have disappeared; or they are
of some use to the animal, in which case they are of no use as arguments
against Teleology." (p. 307.) It would be hard to overestimate
the value of this opinion, still more hard to overrate its
genuine and outspoken honesty.</p>

<p>Mr. Huxley places at the end of his recent volume a passage from
Bishop Berkeley which we will venture to borrow by way of conclusion
to this lengthy note:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see, Hylas, the water of yonder fountain, how it is forced
upwards in a round column to a certain height, at which it breaks
and falls back into the basin from whence it rose; its ascent as well
as its descent proceeding from the same uniform law or principle of
gravitation. Just so, the same principles which, at first view, lead to
scepticism, pursued to a certain point, bring men back to common
sense."</p>

<p><i lang="la">Adsit omen!</i> May it be even thus with our large-minded Professor
and with all other sovereign princes of Biology&mdash;<i lang="el">Ἵλεως Ἀσκληπίος </i>!</p>

<p class="center">SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTER III.</p>


<p class="hang">This Chapter may be characterized as a parallel between the difficulties
alleged to be fatal against Theism, and the difficulties attaching to
very various departments of human knowledge, embracing its most
necessary and its most certainly accepted kinds. From this parallel
the conclusion becomes evident, that whoever accepts one set of
truths cannot be debarred by these or similar difficulties from
accepting the higher truth likewise. That such an acceptance is
natural and valid appears further evident from the fact that a
knowledge of God belongs to the class of Practical beliefs, and is
enforced by the same reasonable necessity. This topic forms the
transition to Chapter IV. on "Our Reasonable Beliefs."</p>

<p class="hang">The same inferences are also stated in a <em>destructive</em> form, <i>e.g.</i>, Should a
thinker choose to deny the possibility of Theism, he ought (if consistent)
to deny all those truths which stand or fall by a parallel set
of reasonings. But by doing this he lands himself in a state of
doubt, so extreme and thorough, that the whole Universe becomes
a rayless blank.</p>

<p>A corollary is added on Materialism.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Analysis</i>&mdash;Man the interpreter of Nature. Nature <em>gives</em> by answering
our interrogations; these must depend on our powers of assimilating
knowledge. Some questions inevitable, <i>e.g.</i>, What are the first
grounds of Truth?</p>

<p class="hang">Has Man any faculty of apprehending the Infinite? Can we know our
own Personality or that of others?&mdash;or any Thing in itself? Inference
against Scepticism based on human ignorance.</p>

<p class="hang">Fallacy of the Unthinkable or Inconceivable. Ideas of Self and not-Self,
inexplicable, yet undoubted. From things as they are, let us turn
to things as they appear. How do we perceive, hear, see?</p>

<p class="hang">Perception as an instrument of Intelligence, inscrutable. We acknowledge
the insoluble mystery but accept the fact.</p>

<p class="hang">Marvels of eyesight, and their problems. How much and what do we
see? Comparison with Sound;&mdash;Form, Colour, Tone. Evidence on
which we receive sense impressions. Comparison between healthy
and diseased sensations,&mdash;between our organs of sense and those of
animals. We soon arrive at a twilight territory of knowledge and
can explain no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Imperfections in our powers of Verification. How great is the subjective
Element in our perceptions? Idealism,&mdash;most difficult to answer
when most extreme. Philosophic denial of all proof of external
things as distinguished from Mind (<i>e.g.</i>, by Mill). Fact-knowledge,
and absurdities involved in the ordinary method of defining and
alleging Facts. Polar tendencies of Phenomenalism which take the
shapes of Idealism and Positivism, resulting in Nihilism or Indifferentism.
The end of these things! Mr. Herbert Spencer on
Theology, compared with Mr. Huxley, and criticized by Mr. J.
Martineau, who denies that the Unknowable can be any object of
religious feeling,&mdash;a protest strongly maintained by Mr. J. S. Mill.</p>

<p class="hang">The difficulties attending every kind of knowledge paralleled with the
difficulties alleged against Theism. If the Inexplicable be also the
Unknowable, there is an end to all knowledge. We cannot predicate
veracity of our human Mind, we cannot even know that we know
anything. Mr. J. S. Mill accepts Mind as an inexplicable Fact
underlying all other Facts and Beliefs. We <em>must</em> accept <em>ultimate</em>
Truths.</p>

<p class="hang">Transition to Chapter IV. on the affirmative evidence for our Reasonable
Beliefs.</p>

<p class="hang">Corollary on Materialism. Far more difficult than its antithesis. Conclusion
to be drawn from these difficulties.</p>

<p class="center"><big>CHAPTER III</big>.</p>

<p class="center">CONDITIONS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE.</p>


<p>Is the great Book of Nature&mdash;the world we live in&mdash;a closed
or open book to Man? On this question all have thought
often,&mdash;and many have written much,&mdash;students&mdash;men of
science&mdash;religious teachers&mdash;poets, and philosophers.</p>

<p>We ask this question of ourselves variously circumstanced,
and under various impulses. We ask it if, like Æschylus'
watchman, we contemplate</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i2">"The congress of the nightly stars</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Bright potentates, set proudly in the sky."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Or when we sail upon a sea made solemn by its vastness,
dying in far distance, with no boundary except itself, as each
swelling wave rises against the sky. We ask it, on some
stately mountain top looking down over light and shadow,&mdash;over
the rest and the motion of the landscape. More earnestly
still, perhaps, while from the depth of a twilight valley we
admire the sunset lingering upon inapproachable alpine snows;&mdash;rosy
heights unveiling their loveliness, yet soon to be hidden
till the Light of this lower world shall shine afresh amongst
their clefts and pinnacles.</p>

<p>And who is not in earnest, as sunset and sunrise remind
him how the majestic clock of Time moves on? Yonder
glorious luminary has warmed with form and life countless
organisms, scattered over mountain summits, in ocean depths,
through wild savannahs and forests;&mdash;organisms throughout
regions of earth, water, air, so remote and inaccessible that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
their wonderful excellence of beauty has never been beheld by
Man's perishable eye. Knowing, as we cannot but know, how
soon our own eyelids must close beneath the sun, we yearn
within our soul, longing for a truer insight into the great
Universe above and beyond us; and for a firmer feeling that
we ourselves are an imperishable part of it. Somewhere in
this Universe, must surely be contained things brighter and
better than those we now possess. Else, why is it clothed so
lavishly with half-revealed charms, adapted to touch our most
delicate sympathies, to win us from our worse selves, and
allure us on like willing captives to its loveliness? Awakened
in our senses, awakened in our souls, we desire to know, to
feel, and to attain;&mdash;these three impulses become our fixed
and enduring aspirations.</p>

<p>But, how? We all remember that Undine sought a soul
and found a sorrow;&mdash;a sorrow the more intolerable, because
through its burden she first realized her hard-earned dower of
coveted immortality. Yet, as she truly says, every creature
cannot but strive after that which is naturally higher than
itself.</p>

<p><em>One</em> secret of progress we soon discover. What Nature can
give us depends on what she can tell us. And here is a prevailing
motive for the endeavour to unclose fair Nature's book.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> step in thought is early taken in our day, though
the civilized world was slow in reaching it. We soon perceive
that Nature's answers must catch their tone and compass
from our interrogations. In numerous sciences, this axiom
carries the whole theory and practice of experiment;&mdash;that
grand distinction between Bacon's inductive process, and the
induction of the ancient world. In other walks of inquiry,
intellectual and moral, the same truth has grown up and
blossomed with a ruling idea of the crucial or prerogative
question: slow in being framed, and difficult often in the
asking, but, when asked, certain to elicit a reply.</p>

<p>A <em>third</em> postulate is also quickly apparent. Our inquiries
must be subject, for utility's sake, to our power of assimilating
knowledge. And thus our faculty for asking questions is
governed by our faculties for apprehending answers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>last</em> and paramount requirement is <em>forced</em> upon us.
Beyond and over all, comes the pressure of our own need and
private anxiety. There are many truths which we discern
afar off, like features of a smiling land of promise; and,
knowing that they must become one day the heritage of
mankind, we tend towards them without haste, yet without
forgetfulness, and in this temper of mind wait contentedly.
But, there are some truths for which we cannot afford to wait.
They concern our destinies too closely; they are too near our
hearts; too influential on our lives and happiness.</p>

<p>The old question asked in the youth of human philosophy,
is the one we all begin by asking in our first confidence and
eagerness of pursuit. Ask it in what words we may, it always
comes to much the same thing; and if we could answer it,
we should answer all questions in one. For, though we clothe
our query with various shapes, and seldom put it in the form
following, its true meaning is, "what are the realities of the
Universe, and what the essential ground of all we see and
think?"</p>

<p>It is always worth a thinker's while to look this human
problem more than once in the face. Suppose a faculty<a name="FNanchor_88_107" id="FNanchor_88_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_107" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
such insight granted, it must be different in kind, rather than
degree, from our logic of ordinary life. It cannot proceed
discursively, abstracting, generalizing, connecting, deducing.
It must know&mdash;or look at its object directly, just as genius
knows, images and conveys to other minds, not through a
train of explanatory definition, but by kindling within them
a spark of its own light. If there be such a faculty, it will
work, (as Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_89_108" id="FNanchor_89_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_108" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> says of the Supreme Intellect,) by what
seems to us most like an act of touch; a figure half-shadowed
out when we say we grasp or apprehend a truth; and much
as St. Paul speaks, in bidding men to seek and feel after and
find the Lord.</p>

<p>We are not all conscious of such a faculty. But if dim to
some, is it certainly dim to all? Did Plato see farther than
Herschel could when he burst the barriers of the sky? Did
Schelling at any time behold what Hamilton pronounced
invisible?<a name="FNanchor_90_109" id="FNanchor_90_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_109" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Or again, if not actually ours now,&mdash;if those who have
asserted it have spoken in error,&mdash;is there a hope that in the
Future of Man individual or collective, he will ever grow up
to it? The thought is not unknown to physicists as well as
moralists. In both camps hopeful minds have conceived the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
possibility. And, <em>then</em> Mankind will look the secret of the
Universe face to face.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thinking men have laid siege to the absolute
Truth by aid of such powers as they commonly call into
action. For centuries past, the nature of things in themselves,&mdash;and
along with (or perhaps above) all other natures,
the "<em>Self</em>" within every man has been among the most fascinating
of objects pursued by human thought. Yet, how far
do we really know the life throbbing in every pulse? Can
we tell the secret of our own individuality? We feel it every
day;&mdash;it endues us with a separate existence, distinctly several,
and apart from others, and so intensely vivid to ourselves, that
we seem in our own eyes like small centres of the Universe,
with men and women,&mdash;nay, worlds and stars,&mdash;revolving
round us.<a name="FNanchor_91_110" id="FNanchor_91_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_110" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Yet, strange to say, our bodies are at all times
undergoing change, sufficient in a few years to eliminate their
present frame, and remould a future compound of gradually
assimilated elements. And it seems stranger still, that while
the law of Change rules supreme in these fabrics,&mdash;(built to be
continually dissolved and continually built again),&mdash;each rude
mark and scar maintains its place; no old wound forgets to
ache; no cicatrice even, nor superficial blemish, dies quite
away. We are always changing, always being transformed;
yet, to each of our bodies continues its one individual configuration;
within each of our minds its self-collection, its memories,
its expectations, and its individual consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_T_111" id="FNanchor_T_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_111" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Weighing these inconsistencies together, shall we say that,
in any proper sense, we <em>know</em> our own selves? And, if not,
can we expect truly to know the <em>self</em> of anything? May we
not travel further, and inquire whether we can conceive a
<em>self-ness</em> of any kind,&mdash;whether the very idea is not to us
absolutely inconceivable? And, when this question is answered
as it must be answered, need we feel surprised if we fall short
of conceiving the self-subsistent God? At what value, therefore,
shall we rate sceptical arguments drawn from our failure;
and resting on the fallacious consequence, that the inconceivable
(or unthinkable as some prefer to call it) is likewise the
impossible?<a name="FNanchor_U_112" id="FNanchor_U_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_112" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<p>That a fallacy really lurks beneath these words,&mdash;that the
contrary is true, we know as a matter of fact.<a name="FNanchor_92_113" id="FNanchor_92_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_113" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> We entertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
really no doubt whatever of our own continued sameness, and
individual existence. We are quite sure that our <em>self-ness</em> has,
gone on throughout the years of our natural life. How it first
became clear to our inward sense, is a point confessedly disputable.
Some suppose that it existed as a principle of consciousness,&mdash;a
kind of primordial instinct in our minds. Others&mdash;that
our internal impressions, one and all, formed a panoramic
scene; impressions from without and impressions from within
evenly painted on the retina of the mental eye. Time and
comparison were needful to give us the true distinction. Those
who think thus usually take another step; and add that
<em>resistance</em> to our <em>self-ness</em> first informs us of its being. There
is resistance to a muscular sense, somewhat akin to touch, but
specialized to feel the kind of impact given by things impenetrable.
There is also a resistance which thwarts our desires,
endeavours, and determinations. Be this as it may, we never
doubt our own identity of being; we never doubt the <em>other-ness</em>
and <em>outer-ness</em> of beings like ourselves, and of objects beyond
number. Yet, that which makes ourselves and them, what
we and they are,&mdash;<em>our</em> self-ness and <em>their</em> self-ness&mdash;raises a
question we cannot answer; here is, we feel, a something
which overpasses our means of investigation. Men, however,
do not stay to discuss such questions, or to test the origin and
limits of intellectual conceptions before accepting the fact.
They do not even ask whether Philosophical victory sits on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the banner of Idealism, pure or constructive; Realism materialistic
or natural;&mdash;or whether it crowns any other imaginable
variety of cosmological theorem. We are perfectly sure of
our facts; and no array of possible difficulties whatsoever can
prevail to shake our assurance.</p>

<p>Let us leave for the present, in its native shadows, the
central point of our own self; the original centre of our earliest
apparent universe. Yet, if we cannot <em>know</em> this first growing-point
of our individual life, it may be useful to inquire what
can we know <em>about</em> it? can we learn, for example, how that
inner vitality, once begun, is maintained and fed?&mdash;By a
process of receiving into itself, (we are told), the aliment which
flows through our senses. We are also told, (as appeared in
the last chapter), how very requisite is a knowledge of <em>natural</em>
processes. Let us, then, look at this process of sense-alimentation,
narrowing the problem as much as possible. We have
already cut off <em>one</em> end of it&mdash;the germ-point of the <em>self</em>-stimulated;
and will now cut off <em>another</em> piece&mdash;the assimilation
of mental ideas when elaborated. We simply ask how
does this food from without, get <em>into</em> us? The widest avenue
of entrance is proverbially our sense of eyesight. Its information,
(as people in general agree, from Horace down to Mr.
Mill), being gathered through many definite impressions, and
received from all distances, is at once the most significant, and
the most commanding. The first step is clear. We see by
impinging rays of light,&mdash;movements in a luminiferous ether,
making images on the sensitive network of the eye; a circumstance
ascertained by the same sense of sight which
receives the image. From this delicate surface, begins a
second series of movements;&mdash;they take place this time in
an organized nerve-material, and are carried, like telegraph-currents,
to the Sensory. Arrived there, we may next
suppose that they excite some new motions, or corpuscular
changes. Do we know&mdash;<em>can</em> we know any more? Is the
grammar or dictionary written which translates them into
the language of the mind; or teaches us how we have,
since our infancy, worked a perpetual miracle of speech
respecting each of them? The eye, as an optical instru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ment,<a name="FNanchor_V_114" id="FNanchor_V_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_114" class="fnanchor">[v]</a>
is a marvel of science displayed; the eye as an
instrument of intelligence, especially of human intelligence,
is a marvel of inscrutable mystery.</p>

<p>The mysteries of every-day life are the last things dreamed
of in every-day philosophy. When we wake up to their
existence, it is astonishing to find how continually, without
being able to explain things, we can feel, and know them;&mdash;know
them that is in the sense of acting intelligently (without
theorizing) upon them.</p>

<p>The example we have taken, teaches us several good and
important lessons. There is in it much we can understand;
much that we cannot understand; and a twilight territory
between the intelligible and the non-intelligible. All three
are, of course, mixed together when we speak of sight,&mdash;in
itself, a matter of every-day experience. So far as the
mechanical construction of an optical chamber goes, everything
seems obvious. We can, likewise, perceive how well
contrived is the apparatus for washing and wiping the outside
transparent surface. Also, the value of its arched hedge
against irritants dropping upon the eyeball from above; and
of the arrangements for altering both axis and focus instantaneously.
But what does this instrument enable us to see?
<em>Not</em> the rays of light themselves,&mdash;only objects which they
illuminate. The space traversed by rays from all suns and
all stars, remains itself unseen. The ether which fills space is
invisible,&mdash;yet its motions make the light of the world.<a name="FNanchor_93_115" id="FNanchor_93_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_115" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
Then, too, the nervous screen on which these ray movements
are received, is not sensitive to all transmitted undulations.
Red excites the optic nerve by striking it with four hundred
and seventy-four <em>millions of millions</em> of wave-impacts in a
single second. Violet strikes it in the same time with six
hundred and ninety-nine <em>millions of millions</em> of impulses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_94_116" id="FNanchor_94_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_116" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
These two colours are the extremes of the light octave. In an
octave of sound, the highest note vibrates twice as quickly as
the lowest. So too, the shortest wave of violet is half the
length of the longest red wave, and its motion is twice as
rapid. But the curious point is that the human ear receives
eleven octaves in the scale of sound;<a name="FNanchor_95_117" id="FNanchor_95_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_117" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>&mdash;the human eye has a
range over only one octave in the scale of light.</p>

<p>Our remarks have carried us over the borders of the
twilight territory,&mdash;a circumstance we may ascertain by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
putting into words what we think we know, and our reasons
for thinking that we know it. If the eye be in focus, (but
not otherwise), a line of light&mdash;that is to say moving imponderable
matter of extreme tenuity&mdash;so passes through its
transparent liquids as to strike a sensitive spot, and there
produce what is called an image. We apprehend in our minds
this image-producing function as a relation between light and
the effect realized. A relation definite and exact,&mdash;in scientific
language a "constant"; which we can formulate into optical
laws, and thus express with useful nicety. Taking advantage
of the laws thus obtained, and employing that light-power
which everywhere blesses our world, we reproduce the <em>like</em>,
image upon a screen. Its likeness we gather from comparison,
by looking into an eye from without. Both images, thus seen
by us, are in point of fact similar sensations.</p>

<p>A philosophic reader may at once perceive what the Idealist
will infer respecting this act of comparison. Neither image&mdash;on
retina or on screen&mdash;exists apart from the eye. So far as
we know, if there were no eyes there would be no images;
and some writers (<i>e.g.</i>, Schleiden) have positively affirmed that
without eyes all would be, not only to us, but <em>in itself</em>, darkness;&mdash;the
world absolutely void of Light. But the truth
may be summed in a sentence. Light is not for the eye in
the same sense that the eye is for light. Light is for other
things besides. It exerts its activity on life, animal and
vegetable;&mdash;on inorganic substances;&mdash;and in other ways
likewise.&mdash;Going no further than our screen, we can so
manage matters as to engrave and otherwise fix the image
thrown upon it;&mdash;in other words our moving line of imponderable
matter will produce further effects, chemical and
mechanical, visible and palpable.</p>

<p>Proceeding to a cross-examination of the knowledge with
which we have credited ourselves, our next business is to try
whether we can verify the objectivity of our optical image.
Now it impresses sight in two respects,&mdash;as superficial form&mdash;and
as colour. The family of forms is, we are aware widely
connected. Sound evokes them. Draw a violin bow across
a string stretched over finely silted sand, and the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
notes will be correlated by a diversity of shapes,<a name="FNanchor_96_118" id="FNanchor_96_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_118" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> into which
the sand will arrange itself. Therefore, we ought to find
means of verifying Form without much difficulty. Indeed we
do so every day satisfactorily; our hands are perpetually
demonstrating the general accuracy of our eyes, and even
those delicate instruments our finger-ends, do not always add
much to the information sight has given us.</p>

<p>But about colour? Distinct colour-waves have (as we said
before) distinct velocities, and are therefore objectively distinguished
even in the inorganic universe. They also act
differently upon the growth of animals and plants,&mdash;and other
distinctions might be added. The <em>sensation</em> is, however,
our point,&mdash;the special thing called colour both by careful
speakers and in child parlance,&mdash;what do we really know
about this? Little indeed except as an impression received
by sight. The man born in complete blindness taking a piece
of red cloth to examine, described the fabric minutely; but,
when asked if he could say anything about its redness,
likened that "hue angry and brave" to the sound of a trumpet.
A simile most conclusive,&mdash;suggested probably by his having
often heard of certain "scarlet-coated gentry";&mdash;and proving
beyond doubt that colour is non-existent in the sensory of
a person affected from birth by a deep-seated lesion. To one
less thoroughly blind, spectra are possible, and red light may
be produced under pressure. It thus appears, that colour
must be perceived by a nervous <em>substratum</em>, called the rod
and cone layer; and hence we explain our power of distinctly
seeing the blood-vessels of the retina lying immediately before
that structure.<a name="FNanchor_97_119" id="FNanchor_97_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_119" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>These curiosities, of vision shew that our powers of verifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
shape are superior to our powers of verifying colour;<a name="FNanchor_98_120" id="FNanchor_98_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_120" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> add,
too, that the latter sensation, (as an idealist might maintain,)
is known to be sometimes unreal, since it occurs without a
coloured object. We can produce it, for instance, by gazing
at the sun&mdash;a phenomenon mentioned by Aristotle. But then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
this ideal sense-affection ranges with a variety of others, which
taken together constitute a very much wider law. Not to
mention many superinduced mental states, we see light under
the influence of a touch or blow,&mdash;of electricity,&mdash;of chemicals,
such as narcotic medicines, which attack the nervous system.
We hear sound under like appliances stimulating the auditory
nerve. And the whole of these affections are to be explained
by another Aristotelian doctrine, extended and pushed to its
consequences. Special senses have their own proper faculties,
and when called into action each exerts its power within its
special province. Had Aristotle dissected out nerve-fibres, he
might have discovered the larger empire of specialty now
known to our anatomists.<a name="FNanchor_99_121" id="FNanchor_99_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_121" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p>Idealism easily widens its doubt, to correspond with the
dimensions of the wider nervous law. Does not an aptitude
for special impressions, so stringently determined as to translate
the antecedent "blow" into the consequent, "light" or
"sound," disqualify our senses for giving evidence respecting
supposed facts of the outer world? As for the "distinctive
impressibility of the eye," as Mr. Bain<a name="FNanchor_100_122" id="FNanchor_100_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_122" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> describes colour, it need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
not be held real except for our own sensorium,<a name="FNanchor_W_123" id="FNanchor_W_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_123" class="fnanchor">[w]</a> and if colour
be a questionable reality, other alleged realities become questionable
too. The world we live in, may be a totally different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
world from what we are taught, generation after generation,
to believe it. Who can lay down the limits of what our minds
create for themselves outside us?<a name="FNanchor_101_124" id="FNanchor_101_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_124" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The mental disease of the
madman causes his eye to see that which is not. Guilt and
sickness fill bedchambers with unreal spectres. Putting disease
aside, and taking the case of healthy eye and healthy mind,
it is confessedly difficult to define the exact province of each.
A boy couched by Cheselden<a name="FNanchor_102_125" id="FNanchor_102_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_125" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> saw all things in one plane;
there was no perspective, and objects in the room seemed to
touch his eyeballs. The mind creates perspective, how much
then may it not create? The mind also refuses to surrender
its own associations at the bidding of optical laws. Mr,
Wheatstone's ingenious instrument called the Pseudoscope,
brings into play laws which reverse the impressions of solidity
and hollowness. A person looking through it steadily at the
face of a statue sees a hollow mask. The convexity of feature
is gone, and a concave set of features (representing the bust
reversed) is perceived in its stead. But, let the same person
gaze through his pseudoscope ever so long at the face of a
human being, and he will look for a like reversal in vain.
The flesh and blood features refuse to change;&mdash;in other
words, the mind refuses to yield its <em>long-accustomed</em> impres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>sion.<a name="FNanchor_103_126" id="FNanchor_103_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_126" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
If these things and others like them are fairly considered,
what becomes of our readings in the unclosed book of Nature?
The nature we see is our own thought reflected back again.
Nature's answers take not only tone and compass, but meaning
and utterance from our own interrogations. We think
that we are assimilating knowledge, when we are actually
engaged in manufacturing aliments to suit our own intellectual
digestions. The most inward of all things,&mdash;our essential
<em>self</em>,&mdash;at once retired into shadow when we pursued it;
and now, in trying to show how <em>self</em> is fed by substance
from without, we have learned to suspect that all its food is
unsubstantial.<a name="FNanchor_X_127" id="FNanchor_X_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_127" class="fnanchor">[x]</a></p>

<p>We may henceforth consider ourselves face to face with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Sphinx; and it is well to take the true measure of her lineaments.
If the above reasoning be sound, to know, is to make
a mirror and reflect ourselves back from it. To verify, is to put
ourselves in new postures before our infallible mirror. Each
fresh item of induction, is a freshly reflected phantom. At all
events, the contrary position will never be established. Ignorant
as we are, respecting the true centre of our mental firmament,
we must necessarily be always more ignorant respecting
all <em>possibilities</em> which seemingly outlie its glowing horizon.
No one who rationally weighs the worth of a fact, or who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
decomposes it into its elementary constituents, will ever be
absurd enough to imagine that he can disprove the ideal
theory by proving the truth of its opposite.</p>

<p>The strongest strain of Idealism comes upon the <em>last</em> sentence.
Some years ago, English philosophers had agreed in
the conclusion that all debates must for the future be settled
by an appeal to facts. Could there be a more happily chosen
ground for arbitration?&mdash;or one better suited to the calibre
of everybody concerning whose business-like reflections we
might say, with King Henry,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"His thinkings are below the moon"?</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Some inquiring spirits preferred "law," but then they agreed
with all others, (except transcendentalists,) that a law to be
valid must also be a fact.</p>

<p>A belief in this settlement still pervades most non-philosophic
circles. A fact is now-a-days an infallible remedy for
the disturbed mind; just as once</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i4">"the sovereign'st thing on earth</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Was parmaceti for an inward bruise."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>A mind too disturbed to abstain from logical litigation when
this receipt is administered, must certainly be afflicted with
monomania. Nobody, of course, (whether Idealist or Transcendentalist,)
need feel much aggrieved by being called mad.
At some time or other, it is the common lot of all, from a
murderer proud of being caught red-handed in our day, to a
Jewish Pharisee and the son of a Pharisee, long ago departed
to his rest. Besides, some madnesses are so fortunate as to
justify themselves, an event now happening to Idealists.<a name="FNanchor_104_128" id="FNanchor_104_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_128" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Germany, France and England, the persuasion gains ground
that no tasks are so difficult as first to define, and secondly to
establish a fact.</p>

<p>Now the task of a Natural Theologian, is to establish, (if he
can), the greatest and most solemn of all facts. In order to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
his work honestly, he must ascertain as far as possible the
conditions of proof, the ground on which fact-knowledge
reposes. And it will be admitted that the problem of evidence
raised by Idealism, is difficult, crucial, and underlies all other
problems. "The most fundamental questions in philosophy,"
says Mr. Mill, "are those which seek to determine what we
are able to know of external objects, and by what evidence we
know it."<a name="FNanchor_105_129" id="FNanchor_105_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_129" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>This field of inquiry is therefore of the most supreme interest
to us. Idealism possesses an additional attraction for any one
who argues under a belief in the final victory of truth. Both
sides of the argument may be placed in high relief, without
incurring the imputation of bad faith, or worse morality; and
thus Idealism furnishes what used to be sought for during the
days of tournaments,&mdash;a strictly neutral, ground.</p>

<p>In this ordeal let no one think a single effort directed</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"To crush a butterfly or brain a gnat."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Reasoners on "hard texts" seldom commit any error between
premises and conclusion;&mdash;granted the former, the other will
surely follow. Most oversights occur&mdash;or are slipped in&mdash;over
the first postulates.<a name="FNanchor_106_130" id="FNanchor_106_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_130" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> These generally appear very simple and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
very true, and pass unquestioned. Yet, no primary truth can ever
be very simple to man, else why so many conscientious doubters?</p>

<p>What indeed can seem more <em>simply</em> true than the admission
of a fact? Yet facts are often inspissated theories, while many
theories are merely explained facts. One of the greatest
authorities on Inductive Philosophy writes thus (Whewell's
Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences. Ed. 2. Vol. I. p. 45)&mdash;"We
are often told that such a thing is <em>a Fact</em>; <span class="smcap">A Fact</span> and
not a Theory, with all the emphasis which, in speaking or
writing, tone or italics or capitals can give. We see from
what has been said, that when this is urged, before we can
estimate the truth, or the value of the assertion, we must ask
to whom is it a Fact? what habits of thought, what previous
information, what Ideas does it imply, to conceive the Fact
as a Fact? Does not the apprehension of the Fact imply
assumptions which may with equal justice be called Theory
and which are perhaps false Theory? in which case, the Fact
is no Fact. Did not the ancients assert it as a Fact, that the
earth stood still, and the stars moved? and can any Fact have
stronger apparent evidence to justify persons in asserting it
emphatically than this had?"</p>

<p>The generality of English jurymen might be expected to
give an affirmative verdict. For have they not seen with
their own eyes the Sun rise up in the East, ascend to the top
of the sky, and go down in the West? And is not seeing,
believing?</p>

<p>The question, what elements are required to yield the product
of trustworthy perception, phenomenon, or fact, is investigated
by Dr. Whewell through several pages preceding the one from
which we have quoted. After discussing it at length, he writes
(p. 42): "And thus, we have an intelligible distinction of Fact
and Theory, if we consider Theory as a conscious, and Fact as
an <em>un</em>conscious inference, from the phenomena which are
presented to our senses."</p>

<p>The subject is in itself so singularly interesting that a few
more extracts are added in our Additional Notes.<a name="FNanchor_Y_131" id="FNanchor_Y_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_131" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> Let the
reader, while perusing them, remember that Idealism once so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
sovereign in its empire, is only the other pole of a line of
thought which just now happens to be in the ascendant.
Both poles strongly resemble half-truths. And what is more
delusive in evidence than a half-truth, or more perilously
sophisticating to the mind of him who utters it?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a><br /><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>
<p>The thorough-paced Idealist deals with the presentations of
his inner consciousness, precisely as the Positivist deals with
the presentations of his outer senses. They are <em>his</em> phenomena,
his facts. Beyond the circumstances of their inward occurrence
and succession he knows and can know nothing. You may
arrange them into series of antecedents and consequents,&mdash;and
then the observation becomes a law,&mdash;a law of association,
uniform order, or necessary connection: whichever you may
choose to call it. In one respect, he has an advantage over the
Positivist. No thinker equidistant from both, is likely to
deny that primary facts are for every man, the phenomena
most immediately apparent to his own consciousness.</p>

<p>Amongst ordinary men, however, the reasoning Idealist
seldom appears; the Idealist in feeling and temper is by no
means rare. A man weary and worn by sorrow or old age,
thinks and speaks of his life as very like a dream. And
numbers who have exhausted the strength of self-controlling
will, loiter along their way, regardless whether a moving
panorama on each hand is or is not, an unreality. Like
travel-tired travellers down the Danube, or the Rhine, they
interweave scenes bright and dark, as they float by, in one
endless train of dimly felt reverie.</p>

<p>The same characteristic holds good in regard to many a
Positivist. Very few people have ever examined those iron
wheels, on which the conclusions of Positively-inclined writers
seem to run so rapidly. They may be flawed&mdash;they may be
true&mdash;hardly any one has thought of sounding them. But
common life has its Positivism, as well as its Chemistry; and
the Positivism of common life is everywhere. It saves labour,&mdash;you
may take facts as you find them. It troubles no one,&mdash;a
Pyrrhonic posture is the easiest of attitudes. It frees busy
people from moral anxieties, ideal terrors, the shadows of
futurity. In short, to men of the world it is neither more nor
less than Indifferentism.</p>

<p>The comparison between these two Nihilistic tendencies
might be pushed farther, but it has been carried far enough
for our purpose. Both sorts, when viewed as principles of
practical life, coincide in yielding the conclusion we now wish
to deduce. It is folly to be deterred from the pursuit of
ultimate truth, by any amount of speculative difficulty whatsoever.
And the reason is plain. Practical truths&mdash;the beliefs
which affect our hearts and lives&mdash;are always ultimate truths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
To give them up, is to give up our highest and best,&mdash;perhaps
our all. It is worse than useless to quail before intellectual
obstacles. The Difficult soon begins to appear the Impossible.</p>

<p>And soon the result ensues, which might naturally be
expected. Is it possible to imagine any discouragement
heavier, than the feeling that we can effect little to acquire
a knowledge of truth, goodness, and God;&mdash;a feeling, that do
what we will, all we want most&mdash;all that is truly Divine&mdash;must
remain to us a darkness or a dream? Let any man
think in his heart, that what ought to rule his life, and raise
him higher than his lower self, is a secret unknowable, and
he loses the fear of doing wrong;&mdash;for how can he help it?&mdash;and
the hope of a brighter and better future;&mdash;for how shall
he attain it? Then, he sits down to wrap himself in cynical
self-sufficingness. Inevitable ignorance is soon developed into
intellectual Pessimism. The death of hope and fear, makes
the man himself a moral Pessimist. Our conscience, sympathy,
devotion, happiness in higher and in lower things alike,&mdash;if
unstirred by vivid emotions&mdash;must become dull and blunted.
Next follows</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"The waveless calm, the slumber of the dead;"&mdash;</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>a state of suspended animation, broken only by fierce stimulants&mdash;the
galvanisms of, our lower life. These are succeeded,
in due course, by spasmodic susceptibilities, which demand at
no distant day the anodyne and the narcotic. And&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Oh, that way madness lies!"&mdash;</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Therefore we repeat it,&mdash;and it cannot too often or too earnestly
be repeated,&mdash;let no man excuse himself from the pursuit of
practical truth<a name="FNanchor_Z_132" id="FNanchor_Z_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_132" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> by any amount of speculative difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
whatsoever. It would be a false optimism to say there is no
difficulty in thinking truly;&mdash;to represent its difficulties as
trifles;&mdash;or to forget the painful fact that they beset our age
of cold erudite criticism, like pitfalls in the Valley of the
Shadow of Death. But, must not all things really great and
good be toilsome to men who are neither very good nor very
great? And have we not, every one of us, who tries to be
good, our proper fields of hard yet repaying work? The bee
gathers honey where one idle schoolboy sees only thorns and
briers&mdash;and where another sucks poison.</p>

<p>In our days, Doubt is thorough. So thorough, that it soon
ceases to be doubt, and the mind passes quickly from its dim
twilight to a rayless blank. Mr. Herbert Spencer puts the
case of Theology as follows (First Principles p. 43): "Criticising
the essential conceptions involved in the different orders
of beliefs, we find no one of them to be logically defensible.
Passing over the consideration of credibility, and confining
ourselves to that of conceivability, we see that Atheism, Pantheism,
and Theism, when rigorously analysed, severally prove
to be absolutely unthinkable." These three conceptions the
writer does in fact analyse after his own fashion,&mdash;briefly
first, pp. 30-36,&mdash;and further on argues the whole question
<i lang="la">in extenso</i>. The result, of course, is that all three "beliefs"
must finally be abandoned. What then becomes of the Absolute
ground, or First Cause of all things? Spencer is too
clear-sighted not to acknowledge that there must in reason be
a First, and an Absolute. "M. Herbert Spencer," says Ravaisson,<a name="FNanchor_107_133" id="FNanchor_107_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_133" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
"en proclamant la grande maxime que nous ne connaissons
rien que de relatif, a fait cependant une réserve
importante. L'idée même du relatif, remarque-t-il, ne saurait
se comprendre sans celle à laquelle elle est opposée. Et nous
concevons, en effet, au delà de toutes les relations de phé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>nomènes,
l'absolu: c'est ce quelque chose qui est placé au
delà de toute science, et qui est l'objet de la religion; quelque
chose seulement de mystérieux, d'obscur, sur quoi on ne peut
avoir, selon M. Spencer, aucune lumière." The last negative
clause is amply justified on p. 113 of "First Principles."
"By continually seeking to know, and being continually
thrown back with a deepened conviction of the impossibility
of knowing, we may keep alive the consciousness that it is
alike our highest wisdom and our highest duty to regard that
through which all things exist as The Unknowable." And this
closing word becomes with Spencer, the constant name of a
Power, the consciousness, of which is "manifested to us
through all phenomena."<a name="FNanchor_108_134" id="FNanchor_108_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_134" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Such a position, maintained by such a writer, has of course
met with ample consideration. Mr. Huxley appears to have
arrived at a somewhat similar conclusion. Of Religion he
says,<a name="FNanchor_109_135" id="FNanchor_109_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_135" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> "Arising, like all other kinds of knowledge, out of the
action and interaction of man's mind, with that which is not
man's mind, it has taken the intellectual coverings of Fetishism
or Polytheism; of Theism or Atheism; of Superstition or
Rationalism. With these, and their relative merits and
demerits, I have nothing to do; but this it is needful for my
purpose to say, that if the religion of the present differs from
that of the past, it is because the theology of the present has
become more scientific than that of the past; because it has
not only renounced idols of wood and idols of stone, but begins
to see the necessity of breaking in pieces the idols built up of
books and traditions and fine-spun ecclesiastical cobwebs, and
of cherishing the noblest and most human of man's emotions,
by worship 'for the most part of the silent sort' at the altar of
the Unknown and Unknowable."</p>

<p>Concerning this general idea (or negation of Idea) Mr. J.
Martineau has made antagonistic observations, by way of
criticism on Mr. Spencer's book. "To say," he writes,<a name="FNanchor_110_136" id="FNanchor_110_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_136" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the First Cause is wholly removed from our apprehension is
not simply a disclaimer of faculty on our part; it is a charge
of inability against the First Cause too.... And in the very
act of declaring the First Cause incognizable, you do not
permit it to remain unknown. For that only is unknown, of
which you can neither affirm nor deny any predicate; here
you deny the power of self-disclosure to the 'Absolute,' of
which therefore something is known;&mdash;viz., that nothing can
be known," And again with much force,<a name="FNanchor_111_137" id="FNanchor_111_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_137" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> "You cannot constitute
a religion out of mystery alone, any more than out of
knowledge alone; nor can you measure the relation of
doctrines to humility and piety by the mere amount of
conscious darkness which they leave. All worship, being
directed to what is <em>above</em> us and transcends our comprehension,
stands in presence of a mystery. But not all that stands
before a mystery is worship."<a name="FNanchor_AA_138" id="FNanchor_AA_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_138" class="fnanchor">[aa]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Mill (doing battle with another antagonist) denies every
attribute claiming faith and worship, to the idea of a <em>morally
Unknowable</em> God. The passage occurs in his Examination of
Hamilton, pp. 123-4. "If, instead of the 'glad tidings' that
there exists a Being in whom all the excellences which the
highest human mind can conceive, exist in a degree inconceivable
to us, I am informed that the world is ruled by a
being whose attributes are infinite, but what they are we
cannot learn, nor what are the principles of his government,
except that 'the highest human morality which we are
capable of conceiving' does not sanction them; convince me
of it, and I will bear my fate as I may. But when I am told
that I must believe this, and at the same time call this being
by the names which express and affirm the highest human
morality, I say in plain terms that I will not. Whatever
power such a being may have over me, there is one thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
which he shall not do: he shall not compel me to worship
him."<a name="FNanchor_AB_139" id="FNanchor_AB_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_139" class="fnanchor">[ab]</a></p>

<p>Now, suppose that instead of siding on this occasion with
Mill and Martineau, we were to accept the alternative offered
by Spencer and Huxley. Would this surrender of Natural
Theology&mdash;or rather of all Theology&mdash;necessitate in reason
any <em>other</em> vast surrender also? We have already answered in
the affirmative. The surrender would penetrate every field
of knowledge and of thought. We have already shewn this.
For, the thread binding the present section into a connected
whole runs thus: Survey the conditions of interrogating, <em>first</em>,
nature; <em>secondly</em>, our own highest nature; <em>next</em>, our senses;
<em>finally</em>, our consciousness; and <em>add</em> to them the enormous
difficulties which attend every step taken in compliance with
those indispensable <em>conditions</em>. Indispensable, that is, to our
knowing anything, of any sort, in any way whatsoever. You
have, then, no right to isolate Theism. It is false logic, to
speak of the intellectual difficulties attaching to our apprehension
of the Deity, as if they were substantial objections.
In this respect, Theism stands within the same category of
speculative perplexity, and reasonable necessity, as do other
supreme truths.<a name="FNanchor_112_140" id="FNanchor_112_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_140" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Put the case to the judgment of Reason, once for all. If we
agreed to accept Herbert Spencer's position, we should consent
to deny that anything can be known of an Absolute. And
the denial would proceed upon <em>this</em> maxim:&mdash;"whatsoever is
inexplicable is also unknowable." Consider, now, what other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
ultimate truths would fall into the same tomb-like Category.
We must silence all human utterance respecting all first
grounds;&mdash;our own individuality;&mdash;and every object of reason
which becomes inconceivable, when we attempt to define it
by the processes of ordinary logic. All utterance respecting
our own senses and sensations;&mdash;our own existence, as beings
distinct from a world of beings and things really existing
outside us.</p>

<p>In fine, we could never know that we <em>know</em> either anything
or nothing; for, we should have silenced the deepest of all
utterances,&mdash;<em>the</em> one upon which all truth and reason depend.
We should have relegated our Mind along with our God, to
the same abysmal gulf of the Unknowable. Henceforth, we
could predicate of Mind nothing essential to purposes of
knowledge,&mdash;and least of all essentials,&mdash;Veracity.</p>

<p>Mr. Mill closes his laborious endeavours to explain our
natural belief in Mind as follows: "The truth is, that we are
here face to face with that final inexplicability, at which, as
Sir W. Hamilton observes, we inevitably arrive when we
reach ultimate facts; and in general, one mode of stating it
only appears more incomprehensible than another, because the
whole of human language is accommodated to the one, and is
so incongruous with the other, that it cannot be expressed in
any terms which do not deny its truth. The real stumbling-block
is perhaps not in any theory of the fact, but in the fact
itself. The true incomprehensibility perhaps is, that something
which has ceased, or is not yet in existence, can still be
in a manner, present: that a series of feelings, the infinitely
greater part of which is past or future, can be gathered up, as
it were, into a single present conception, accompanied by a
belief of reality. I think, by far the wisest thing we can do,
is to accept the inexplicable fact, without any theory of how
it takes place; and when we are obliged to speak of it in
terms which assume a theory, to use them with a reservation
as to their meaning."<a name="FNanchor_113_141" id="FNanchor_113_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_141" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Two pages further he ingenuously
adds: "I do not profess to have adequately accounted for the
belief in Mind." In other words, the perplexities remain on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Mill's system as they do on all systems. But the Belief and
the Fact remain likewise.</p>

<p>It is the same with our belief of other ultimate facts. We
live an individual life,&mdash;we know not what. We see and
perceive,&mdash;we know not how. Yet such are the facts, and we
thoroughly believe and act upon them.</p>

<p>The pivot on which these and similar beliefs turn is a
subject of the greatest interest and importance. On this same
pivot turns our primary affirmative Argument for Natural
Theism. To establish it will be the purpose of the next
Chapter, and a succession of affirmative arguments, separate
but convergent, will occupy the remainder of this Essay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Corollary</span>:&mdash;If any reader of these pages has felt the
fascination of some one among the many materializing
hypotheses now in vogue, let him remember that, in fair
debate, Materialism can never have the slightest chance
against Idealism.</p>

<p>All materializing theories labour under an enormous weight
of unverified postulates. They set out from neither the most
<em>natural</em>, nor yet the <em>surest</em>, sources of our knowledge.
Naturally, we start from <em>self-ness</em>, and learn to put outer
things and beings in opposition to our own primary self-consciousness.</p>

<p>In after life, when we ask <em>why</em> we are sure of any kind of
knowledge; the primary truths upon which <em>all</em> our reasonings
proceed, are always the presentations of our own mind.</p>

<p>If we proceed to analyse accepted relativities, we soon perceive
that Mind enters into our facts, and also into our sense-presentations.
In particular, an examination of the noblest
of all senses&mdash;the sense of sight&mdash;will convince any careful
analyst that such is undeniably the case. The reader may
recal Mr. Mill's words,<a name="FNanchor_114_142" id="FNanchor_114_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_142" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>&mdash;"I do not believe that the real
externality to us of anything, except other minds, is capable
of proof." "For ourselves," says Professor Fraser, "we can
conceive only&mdash;(1) An externality to our present and transient
experience in <em>our own</em> possible experience past and future,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and (2) An externality to our own conscious experience, in
the contemporaneous, as well as in the past or future
experience of <em>other minds</em>"<a name="FNanchor_115_143" id="FNanchor_115_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_143" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In this view Mr. Mill (who
quotes Fraser), entirely acquiesces, and in this same spirit he
writes, "Matter may be defined, a Permanent Possibility of
Sensation;"<a name="FNanchor_116_144" id="FNanchor_116_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_144" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>&mdash;and adds that he can accept no other definition.</p>

<p>Whether the reader can or cannot define Matter otherwise;
he will, at all events, perceive that the Materialist assumes as
<em>his</em> primary postulate, that which is by no means <em>the</em> primary
fact accepted by Mankind. He starts with taking Matter for
granted;&mdash;but, if he inquires, he will discover that Matter is
known to him in the <em>second</em> place only; he really <em>first</em> knew
Mind. When he questions sensation, or consciousness, he
questions Mind; and, throughout his whole life, theoretical as
well as practical, Mind is <em>nearer</em> to him, and more <em>strongly</em>
evidenced, than any other "Possibility" whatsoever.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the <em>first</em> heavy burden of unauthorized
postulation, which the Materialist's theory binds upon him.
But, in the task of postulating without authority from
Nature, it seems impossible to stop short. Mind, being an
absolute necessity, must be got in some way&mdash;(from Matter
of course)&mdash;evolved, correlated, secreted. No account is given
<em>how</em> Matter could have been thus transformed and glorified.
Yet, in default of such account, it is impossible to divine <em>why</em>
that primary postulate ever existed at all.</p>

<p>The highest attenuation of Matter can no more help to
explain Life or Mind, than to say that brain, (deprived of its
vitality,) is composed of cerebrin, lecythin, and cholesterin,
explains its sensibility, and other vital and intellectual endowments.
And we encounter the same unbridged gulf at every
turn of the materialistic hypothesis. There is a wide gap
between the inorganic world and all organisms, vegetable or
animal. We are, however, told that when certain inorganic
elements are combined, under certain conditions, they form
protoplasm,&mdash;a substance manifesting phenomena of vitality.
The elements are known,&mdash;the conditions are unknown,&mdash;and
until protoplasm has been produced by a chemical experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>menter,
instead of within a living laboratory, we may safely
believe that the unknown conditions form the essential cause
of the production. And we are given to understand by
Professor Huxley,<a name="FNanchor_117_145" id="FNanchor_117_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_145" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> that on this subject speculation has been
premature.</p>

<p>The gap between Body and Mind is wider still. Body has
its known properties,&mdash;measurable figure, weight, and other
like specialties. Mind has its properties also,&mdash;such as
intelligence, emotion, reason, will. <em>Thinking</em> has never been
shown to be a property of Body; nor have <em>weight</em> and
<em>measure</em> been applied to Mind. The laws of each differ as
decisively as their properties. Body obeys gravitation,
cohesion, and chemical affinity. Mind has its laws of reasoning,
mathematically, logically, analogically. Now, what
resemblance is here visible?<a name="FNanchor_118_146" id="FNanchor_118_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_146" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Body cannot compel Will,&mdash;but
is moved by it; and there is no more verisimilitude
known to us of Body to Will, than there exists between the
noble thought of a high-souled Man and the paving-stone he
walks upon. The foregoing is, as every honest materialist
will acknowledge, but a slight specimen of the many
difficulties of Materialism. So little does any materializing
process of "resolution" really resolve anything, that <em>any</em>&mdash;even
the most plausible&mdash;can only be pronounced an abortive
attempt to bring something near and familiar to us, out of
something unknowably remote.</p>

<p>The materialist's allegation is generally, that he wishes to
accept as little as possible. But the accusation of the natural
Theologian against Materialism, is that it accepts far too
much. Mind being a necessary and indispensable fact, the
one fact underlying all other facts,&mdash;whoever is bent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
simplifying his beliefs, had better begin by believing in his
own Soul. And if further bent on viewing all things as
"resolvable," his surest wisdom will be to resolve Matter into
Mind. It is really the easier alternative, and has a double
merit,&mdash;it starts from the best-known fact, and it satisfies
his desire for "simplification."</p>

<p>At all events, the consequences resulting from Materialism,
are too serious to permit a disregard of Probability. We
must, surely, find and follow the very best guide we can:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"These are no school-points; nice philosophy</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">May tolerate unlikely arguments,</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">But heaven admits no jests."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Huxley,<a name="FNanchor_119_147" id="FNanchor_119_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_147" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> who sees advantages (simplicity and unification)
in employing a materialistic terminology, adds the very
striking caution&mdash;"But the man of science, who, forgetting the
limits of philosophical inquiry, slides from these" (materialistic)
"formulæ and symbols into what is commonly understood
by materialism, seems to me to place himself on a level
with the mathematician, who should <em>mistake</em> the x's and y's,
with which he works his problems, <em>for real entities</em>&mdash;and with
this further disadvantage, as compared with the mathematician,
that the blunders of the latter are of no practical consequence,
while the errors of systematic materialism may
paralyse the energies and destroy the beauty of a life."</p>

<p>The words italicized are remarkable. The materializing
<i lang="fr">façons de parler</i> do not embody a knowledge of "real entities"
after all. And such is the language of one<a name="FNanchor_120_148" id="FNanchor_120_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_148" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> who stands in the

<h3>ADDITIONAL NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS TO
CHAPTER III.</h3>


<h4><a id="A.3"></a>A.&mdash;ACCOUNT OF SOME THEORIES RESPECTING OUR
PERSONAL IDENTITY.</h4>

<p>In a sentence worthy of the pen of Glanvill or of Sir T. Browne,
Locke remarked "The <em>Ideas</em>, as well as Children of our Youth, often
die before us: And our Minds represent to us those Tombs, to which
we are approaching; where, though the Brass and Marble remain,
yet the Inscriptions are effaced by Time, and the Imagery moulders
away. <em>The Pictures drawn in our Minds, are laid in fading Colours</em>,
and if not sometimes refreshed, vanish and disappear." <cite>On Retention</cite>,
B. II., chap. x. 5.</p>

<p>This truly human feeling did not hinder Locke from writing (chap,
xxvii.) on the subject of Self-ness in a manner which appeared to
imply that Consciousness, or Consciousness <em>plus</em> Memory "<em>made</em>"
Personal Identity;&mdash;or to use Reid's words "whatever hath the
consciousness of present and past actions, is the same person to
whom they belong."</p>

<p>Bishop Butler's strictures on the topic are known to most students:
but, as Sir William Hamilton observes (Foot-note on Reid, pp. 350,
351), "Long before Butler, to whom the merit is usually ascribed,
Locke's doctrine of Personal Identity had been attacked and refuted.
This was done even by his earliest critic, John Sergeant, whose
words, as he is an author wholly unknown to all historians of
philosophy, and his works of the rarest, I shall quote. He thus
argues:&mdash;'The former distinction forelaid, he (Locke) proceeds to
make <em>personal identity in man to consist in the consciousness that we
are the same thinking thing in different times and places</em>. He proves
it, because consciousness is inseparable from thinking, and, as it
seems to him, <em>essential</em> to it.... But, to speak to the point: Consciousness
of any action or other accident we have now, or have had,
is nothing but our knowledge that it belonged to us; and, since we
both agree that we have no innate knowledges, it follows, that all,
both actual and habitual knowledges, which we have, are acquired or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
accidental to the subject or knower. <em>Wherefore, the man, or that
thing which is to be the knower, must have had individuality or personality,
from other principles, antecedently to this knowledge, called
consciousness: and, consequently, he will retain his identity, or continue
the same man, or (which is equivalent) the same person, as long as he
has those individuating principles....</em> It being then most evident,
<em>that a man must be the same, ere he can know or be conscious that he
is the same</em>, all his laborious descants and extravagant consequences
which are built upon this supposition, that consciousness individuates
the person, can need no farther refutation.'</p>

<p>"The same objection was also made by Leibnitz in his strictures
on Locke's Essay....</p>

<p>"For the best criticism of Locke's doctrine of Personal Identity,
I may, however, refer the reader to M. Cousin's '<cite>Cours de
Philosophie</cite>.'"</p>

<p>One of Locke's arguments is worthy of attention from its oddity.
He says (chap. xxvii. 20), "But if it be possible for the same Man
to have distinct incommunicable Consciousnesses at different Times,
it is past doubt the same Man would at different Times make different
Persons; which, we see, is the Sense of Mankind in the solemnest
Declaration of their Opinions, Human Laws not punishing the <em>Mad
Man</em> for the <em>Sober Man's</em> Actions, nor the <em>Sober Man</em> for what the
<em>Mad Man</em> did, thereby making them two Persons; which is somewhat
explained by our Way of speaking in <em>English</em>, when we say,
such a one <em>is not himself</em>, or is <em>besides himself</em>; in which Phrases it is
insinuated, as if those who now, or at least, first used them, thought
that <em>Self</em> was changed, the <em>self</em> same Person was no longer in that
Man."</p>

<p>It appears strange that so acute a writer should not have perceived
the true consequences to be deduced from his observation.
We never really treat a man who goes mad as becoming another
personage. But if he has lost his self-control from causes by himself
uncontrollable, we do not punish his criminalities, and we do divest
him of his social powers; he can neither vote for Parliament,
bequeath property, nor do many other acts, during the period of his
affliction. But we use all means for his cure, and rejoice at his
return to health and society. If a man "beside himself" were "a
different person," then "tipsy he" would certainly not be "ipse he."&mdash;Yet
the father of ethical science decided that the criminal drunkard
deserves double meed of punishment.</p>

<p>To Locke's theory of Personal Identity Hamilton dedicates one
more note. He gives (<cite>Reid</cite>, p. 353), an extract from Lord Kames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
(<cite>Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural Religion</cite>), who
pronounces his own opinion and appends some unpublished remarks
of Dr. Reid. "Mr. Locke, writing on personal identity, has fallen
short of his usual accuracy. He inadvertently jumbles together the
identity that is nature's work, with our knowledge of it. Nay, he
expresses himself sometimes as if identity had no other foundation
than that knowledge. I am favoured by Dr. Reid with the following
thoughts on personal identity:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'All men agree that personality is indivisible; a part of a person
is an absurdity. A man who loses his estate, his health, an arm, or
a leg, continues still to be the same person. My personal identity,
therefore, is the continued existence of that indivisible thing which
I call myself. I am not thought; I am not action; I am not feeling;
but I think, and act, and feel. Thoughts, actions, feelings, change
every moment; but <em>self</em>, to which they belong, is permanent. If it
be asked how I know that it is permanent, the answer is, that I
know it from memory. Everything I remember to have seen, or
heard, or done, or suffered, convinces me that I existed at the time
remembered. But, though it is from memory that I have the
knowledge of my personal identity, yet personal identity must exist
in nature, independent of memory; otherwise, I should only be the
same person as far as my memory serves me; and what would
become of my existence during the intervals wherein my memory has
failed me? My remembrance of any of my actions does not make
me to be the person who did the action, but only makes me know
that I was the person who did it. And yet it was Mr. Locke's
opinion, that my remembrance of an action is what makes me to be
the person who did it; a pregnant instance that even men of the
greatest genius may sometimes fall into an absurdity. Is it not an
obvious corollary, from Mr. Locke's opinion, that he never was born?
He could not remember his birth; and, therefore, was not the person
born at such a place and at such a time.'"</p>

<p>When we come to Hume, the case is considerably altered. He
opens the question after his own manner by asking <em>how</em> the fact
commonly stated can be; and using the difficulty of explaining this
"how" as a sufficient objection against the fact asserted. "There
are some philosophers," he writes (<cite>Treatise</cite>, B. I., Part iv., Sect. 6),
"who imagine we are every moment intimately conscious of what
we call our <em>self</em>; that we feel its existence and its continuance in
existence; and are certain, beyond the evidence of a demonstration,
both of its perfect identity and simplicity....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Unluckily all these positive assertions are contrary to that very
experience, which is pleaded for them, nor have we any idea of <em>self</em>,
after the manner it is here explained. For from what impression
could this idea he derived?... If any impression gives rise to the
idea of self, that impression must continue invariably the same,
through the whole course of our lives; since self is supposed to
exist after that manner. But there is no impression constant and
invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and sensations
succeed each other, and never all exist at the same time. It cannot
therefore be from any of these impressions, or from any other, that
the idea of self is derived; and consequently there is no such idea....
For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call
<em>myself</em>, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of
heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I
never can catch <em>myself</em> at any time without a perception, and never
can observe anything but the perception.... The mind is a kind
of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance;
pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of
postures and situations. There is properly no <em>simplicity</em> in it at one
time, nor <em>identity</em> in different; whatever natural propension we may
have to imagine that simplicity and identity. The comparison of the
theatre must not mislead us. They are the successive perceptions
only, that constitute the mind; nor have we the most distant notion
of the place, where these scenes are represented, or of the materials,
of which it is composed."</p>

<p>It is curious that Hume wishing to represent Mind as a melting
mist of successive perceptions, should be driven into the use of a
word which implied a something continuing and permanent as
affording the <em>stage</em> on which all passing scenes called "impressions"
are enacted.</p>

<p>Hume next discusses the laws of association; and then proceeds
(same Section sub fin.) "As memory alone acquaints us with the
continuance and extent of this succession of perceptions, 'tis to be
considered, upon that account chiefly, as the source of personal
identity. Had we no memory, we never should have any notion of
causation, nor consequently of that chain of causes and effects, which
constitute our self or person. But having once acquired this notion of
causation from the memory, we can extend the same chain of causes,
and consequently the identity of our persons beyond our memory,
and can comprehend times, and circumstances, and actions, which
we have entirely forgot, but suppose in general to have existed. For
how few of our past actions are there, of which we have any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
memory? Who can tell me, for instance, what were his thoughts
and actions on the first of January, 1715, the eleventh of March,
1719, and the third of August, 1733? Or will he affirm, because he
has entirely forgot the incidents of these days, that the present self is
not the same person with the self of that time; and by that means
overturn all the most established notions of personal identity? In
this view therefore memory does not so much <em>produce</em> as <em>discover</em>
personal identity, by shewing us the relation of cause and effect
among our different perceptions. 'Twill be incumbent on those
who affirm that memory produces entirely our personal identity,
to give a reason why we can thus extend our identity beyond our
memory.</p>

<p>"The whole of this doctrine leads us to a conclusion, which is of
great importance in the present affair, viz., that all the nice and
subtile questions concerning personal identity can never possibly be
decided, and are to be regarded rather as grammatical than as philosophical
difficulties. Identity depends on the relations of ideas; and
these relations produce identity, by means of that easy transition they
occasion. But as the relations, and the easiness of the transition
may diminish by insensible degrees, we have no just standard by
which we can decide any dispute concerning the time, when they
acquire or lose a title to the name of identity. All the disputes concerning
the identity of connected objects are merely verbal, except so
far as the relation of parts gives rise to some fiction or imaginary
principle of union, as we have already observed."</p>

<p>If any one feels dissatisfied with these conclusions our author is
ready with his apology&mdash;"The <em>intense</em> view of these manifold contradictions
and imperfections in human reason has so wrought upon me,
and heated my brain, that I am ready to reject all belief and
reasoning, and can look upon no opinion even as more probable or
likely than another. Where am I, or what? From what causes do
I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return? Whose
favour shall I court, and whose anger must I dread? What beings
surround me? and on whom have I any influence, or who have any
influence on me? I am confounded with all these questions, and
begin to fancy myself in the most deplorable condition imaginable,
environed with the deepest darkness, and utterly deprived of the use
of every member and faculty.</p>

<p>"Most fortunately it happens, that since reason is incapable of
dispelling these clouds, nature herself suffices to that purpose, and
cures me of this philosophical melancholy and delirium, either by
relaxing this bent of mind, or by some avocation, and lively impres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>sion
of my senses, which obliterate all these chimeras. I dine, I play
a game of back-gammon, I converse, and am merry with my friends;
and when after three or four hours' amusement, I would return to
these speculations, they appear so cold, and strained, and ridiculous,
that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any farther."
(Part iv., Section 7.)</p>

<p>Is not this good-humoured? Is it not a piece of pleasant
bantering, to be equalled only by certain French philosophers? The
real conclusion, however, winds up his First Book and runs as
follows:&mdash;"A true sceptic will be diffident of his philosophical
doubts, as well as of his philosophical conviction; and will never
refuse any innocent satisfaction, which offers itself, upon account of
either of them.</p>

<p>"Nor is it only proper we should in general indulge our inclination
in the most elaborate philosophical researches, notwithstanding
our sceptical principles, but also that we should yield (sic) to that
propensity, which inclines us to be positive and certain in <em>particular
points</em>, according to the light, in which we survey them in any
<em>particular instant</em>. 'Tis easier to forbear all examination and inquiry,
than to check ourselves in so natural a propensity, and guard against
that assurance, which always arises from an exact and full survey of
an object. On such an occasion we are apt not only to forget our
scepticism, but even our modesty too; and make use of such terms
as these, <em>'tis evident</em>, <em>'tis certain</em>, <em>'tis undeniable</em>; which a due
deference to the public ought, perhaps, to prevent. I may have
fallen into this fault after the example of others; but I here enter a
<em>caveat</em> against any objections, which may be offered on that head;
and declare that such expressions were extorted from me by the
present view of the object, and imply no dogmatical spirit, nor
conceited idea of my own judgment, which are sentiments that I am
sensible can become nobody, and a sceptic still less than any other.<a name="FNanchor_121_149" id="FNanchor_121_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_149" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is obvious to remark that no amount of easiness would maintain
most minds in this balanced position of the pleasant know-nothing
man. The general tendency would be to acknowledge the negative
side alone. And it would be well if an absence of serious convictions,
seriously asserted, and acted on, did not gradually weaken the sense
of Responsibility by making Truth appear indifferent because unattainable.</p>

<p>We, however, are just now more concerned with two other equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
obvious comments. One, that Hume appears to take for granted the
point at issue. Suppose it for argument's sake to be true that
impressions and ideas (as described by him) make up our whole
ordinary consciousness; does this shew that no latent power or
entity exists by which we <em>become</em> conscious of those passing trains?
When impressed by colours, are we conscious of an optic nerve,
retina, crystalline lens and other instrumental powers of vision?
Can we, if we try, perceive by sense the nerve-currents brainwards,
or the sensory which receives and compares them? In both cases
(eye and inward eye) pathology affords an evidence of consciousness
which happy health refuses us. The brainsick sense sees colours and
phantoms which are not&mdash;the disordered mind dwells on impressions
and ideas absolutely unreal, and acts on them as stern realities.
And thus our own purely subjective states reveal to us our own
subjectivity. 'Tis so in fevers, in lunacies, in vices&mdash;'tis so to the
drowning or the desperate man. These mournful changes which
pass over ourselves issue from an interior activity of self-ness and
form one of its commonest verifications.</p>

<p>This first comment admits of extension. If we endeavour to
introduce experiment (as well as experience) into Mental Science,
must we not ask a previous question:&mdash;Shall this or that experiment
be tried? In other words, by what inner law shall we shape our
inquiries so as to gain useful facts for our intended induction?&mdash;Nay,
we may further ask: What inner Being is to settle the questions,
criticize them, and judge the final issue? And if we seem to see our
way on these topics, we may feel pretty sure that whenever our
psychology comes to practical trial, we proceed as being sure of a
Self, more or less <em>self-conscious of Self</em>, and are quite confident that
its self-ness will continue during the whole time of our investigations.</p>

<p>Our second comment may be simply summed, but the consideration
given to it ought to be minute and careful. Suppose instead of
successive perceptions, impressions, or ideas, we substitute a succession
of phenomena, and then apply to them Hume's line of thought,
we have an acute statement of the modern teachings which relegate
the noblest part of our Nature, our reasonings and our beliefs to the
territory of the Unknowable. In a word, all knowledge thus seems
to be gained by "looking on," none by "looking in." Truth within
ourselves especially if it manifests a Truth above ourselves is made
to appear hopeless. And so far does the process of Elimination
extend, that principles involved even in our "looking on" must not
be drawn out of their latency, for fear they should become accepted
parts of knowledge. Let any thinker repeat with this substitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the Personal Identity argument in his own mind, and he will soon
see what a shadow is cast over an infinitely wider world of thought.<a name="FNanchor_122_150" id="FNanchor_122_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_150" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The same process of repetition ought in fairness to produce
another effect. Are not these philosophic <i lang="la">argutiæ</i>, these Pyrrhonic
subtilties closely akin to the difficulties raised against <em>all</em> first
principles; and more particularly all Theistic principles? But does
anybody on their account doubt his own Self-ness or Identity? Or does
any one refuse to act on the supposition of <em>other-ness</em>, and <em>outer-ness</em>, or
ignore his world of fellow-men and hard objectivities which press
upon him from every side? Why then should anybody ignore on
their account the great First-Cause?</p>

<p>In the text of Chapter III. the elements of our reasonable belief in
our own Personal self-ness and sameness have been shortly mentioned;&mdash;of
such work-day belief, that is to say, as suffices for
actual life, and gains from it, and throughout it, a perpetual verification.
If any one wishes to go deeper than this, he must inquire upon
what evidence first principles are accepted by reasoning men; what
difficulties attach to such principles; and under what conditions these
difficulties are held to be nugatory. This inquiry is troublesome but
promises real satisfaction. We have not, therefore, declined it, as
may be seen in the ensuing Chapter. One fact is manifest beforehand&mdash;that
whatever evidence is presupposed valid by those first
principles of every-day knowledge, may be safely presupposed,
accepted, and reasoned upon, in the ground-work of Natural
Theology.</p>

<p>It was Hume's object to push his scepticism to its most extreme
verge. Thus pushed, it "so wrought upon" him that he was
"ready to reject all belief and reasoning" till a return to every-day
life made his speculations appear in his own eyes "cold and strained
and ridiculous." What then was the inference Hume himself intended?
Which was really groundless&mdash;every-day belief or scepticism?
Will his useful dilemma induce the reader to receive Kant's
excuse for the celebrated doubter, when he bids us let the man alone
because he is but trying the strength of human reason? At all
events, Hume's way of stating his case seems to justify the old
remark, that, while Superstition is refuted by Reason, Nature itself
refutes the Sceptic.</p>

<h4><a id="B.3"></a>B.&mdash;EXTRACTS FROM POPULAR LECTURES, BY PROFESSOR
HELMHOLTZ, ON THE RECENT PROGRESS
OF THE THEORY OF VISION.</h4>

<p>"If now we compare the eye with other optical instruments, we
observe the advantage it has over them in its very large field of vision.
This for each eye separately is 160° (nearly two right angles) laterally,
and 120° vertically, and for both together somewhat more than two
right angles from right to left. The field of view of instruments
made by art is usually very small, and becomes smaller with the
increased size of the image.</p>

<p>"But we must also admit, that we are accustomed to expect in
these instruments complete precision of the image in its entire extent,
while it is only necessary for the image on the retina to be exact
over a very small surface, namely, that of the yellow spot. The
diameter of the central pit corresponds in the field of vision to an
angular magnitude which can be covered by the nail of one's forefinger
when the hand is stretched out as far as possible. In this
small part of the field our power of vision is so accurate that it can
distinguish the distance between two points, of only <em>one minute</em> angular
magnitude, <i>i.e.</i> a distance equal to the sixtieth part of the diameter
of the finger-nail. This distance corresponds to the width of one of
the cones of the retina. All the other parts of the retinal image are
seen imperfectly, and the more so the nearer to the limit of the retina
they fall. So that the image which we receive by the eye is like a
picture, minutely and elaborately finished in the centre, but only
roughly sketched in at the borders. But although at each instant we
only see a very small part of the field of vision accurately, we see
this in combination with what surrounds it, and enough of this outer
and larger part of the field, to notice any striking object, and particularly
any change that takes place in it. All of this is unattainable in
a telescope.</p>

<p>"But if the objects are too small, we cannot discern them at all
with the greater part of the retina.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">'When, lost in boundless blue on high,</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">The lark pours forth his thrilling song,'</span></div>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p>the 'ethereal minstrel' is lost until we can bring her image to a focus
upon the central pit of our retina. Then only are we able to <em>see</em> her.</p>

<p>"To <em>look</em> at anything means to place the eye in such a position that
the image of the object falls on the small region of perfectly clear
vision. This we may call <em>direct</em> vision, applying the term <em>indirect</em> to
that exercised with the lateral parts of the retina&mdash;indeed with all
except the yellow spot.</p>

<p>"The defects which result from the inexactness of vision and the
smaller number of cones in the greater part of the retina are compensated
by the rapidity with which we can turn the eye to one point
after another of the field of vision, and it is this rapidity of movement
which really constitutes the chief advantage of the eye over
other optical instruments....</p>

<p>"A great part of the importance of the eye as an organ of expression
depends on the same fact; for the movements of the eyeball&mdash;its
glances&mdash;are among the most direct signs of the movement of the
attention, of the movements of the mind, of the person who is looking
at us." <cite>Popular Lectures on Scientific Subjects</cite>, pp. 212-214.</p>

<p>The great German next proceeds to catalogue some principal defects
of the Eye. 1. Chromatic aberration connected with 2. spherical
aberration and defective centering of the cornea and lens, together
producing the imperfection known as astigmatism, and 3. irregular
radiation round the images of illuminated points. "Now," adds
Helmholtz, "it is not too much to say that if an optician wanted
to sell me an instrument which had all these defects, I should think
myself quite justified in blaming his carelessness in the strongest
terms, and giving him back his instrument. Of course, I shall not do
this with my eyes, and shall be only too glad to keep them as long as
I can&mdash;defects and all. Still, the fact that, however bad they may be,
I can get no others, does not at all diminish their defects, so long as
I maintain the narrow but indisputable position of a critic on purely
optical grounds." (p. 219.)</p>

<p>He then goes on to other faults. 4. Defective transparency. 5.
Floating corpuscules (Muscæ Volitantes). 6. The "blind spot" with
other gaps in the field of vision. "So much," he concludes, "for
the physical properties of the Eye. If I am asked why I have spent
so much time in explaining its imperfection to my readers, I answer,
as I said at first, that I have not done so in order to depreciate the
performances of this wonderful organ, or to diminish our admiration
of its construction. It was my object to make the reader understand,
at the first step of our inquiry, that it is not any mechanical perfection
of the organs of our senses which secures for us such wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>fully
true and exact impressions of the outer world. The next section
of this inquiry will introduce much bolder and more paradoxical conclusions
than any I have yet stated. We have now seen that the eye
in itself is not by any means so complete an optical instrument as it
first appears: its extraordinary value depends upon the way in which
we use it: its perfection is practical, not absolute.... Wherever
we scrutinise the construction of physiological organs, we find the
same character of practical adaptation to the wants of the organism;
although, perhaps, there is no instance which we can follow out so
minutely as that of the eye.</p>

<p>"For the eye has every possible defect that can be found in an
optical instrument, and even some which are peculiar to itself; but
they are all so counteracted, that the inexactness of the image which
results from their presence very little exceeds, under ordinary conditions
of illumination, the limits which are set to the delicacy of
sensation by the dimensions of the retinal cones....</p>

<p>"The adaptation of the eye to its function is, therefore, most
complete, and is seen in the very limits which are set to its defects.
Here the result which may be reached by innumerable generations
working under the Darwinian law of inheritance, coincides with what
the wisest Wisdom may have devised beforehand. A sensible man
will not cut firewood with a razor, and so we may assume that each
step in the elaboration of the eye must have made the organ more
vulnerable and more slow in its development. We must also bear in
mind that soft, watery animal textures must always be unfavourable
and difficult material for an instrument of the mind....</p>

<p>"But, apparently, we are not yet come much nearer to understanding
sight. We have only made one step: we have learnt how
the optical arrangement of the eye renders it possible to separate the
rays of light which come in from all parts of the field of vision, and
to bring together again all those that have proceeded from a single
point, so that they may produce their effect upon a single fibre of the
optic nerve.</p>

<p>"Let us see, therefore, how much we know of the sensations of
the eye, and how far this will bring us towards the solution of the
problem." P. 226, seq.</p>

<p>From the Professor's mention of "much bolder and more paradoxical
conclusions," the final result of his next inquiry may be anticipated.
Sensation is so far from making evident the truth of our
visual knowledge that it increases our perplexities tenfold. "The
inaccuracies," he tells us, "and imperfections of the eye as an optical
instrument, and those which belong to the image on the retina, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
appear insignificant in comparison with the incongruities which we
have met with in the field of sensation. One might almost believe
that Nature had here contradicted herself on purpose, in order to
destroy any dream of a pre-existing harmony between the outer and
the inner world.</p>

<p>"And what progress have we made in our task of explaining Sight?
It might seem that we are farther off than ever; the riddle only more
complicated, and less hope than ever of finding out the answer. The
reader may perhaps feel inclined to reproach Science with only knowing
how to break up with fruitless criticism the fair world presented to us
by our senses, in order to annihilate the fragments." (p. 269.)</p>

<p>How triumphant does Idealism now appear! How little trustworthy
that boasted sense of which mankind have constantly said,
"seeing is believing," although an apostle and philosophers innumerable
have put the two in opposition!</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, instead of leading to a "triumph of Idealism,"
the paradoxes and incongruities&mdash;in a word, the vast accumulation of
the Unknowable&mdash;belonging to eyesight <em>considered as a Sensation</em>,
must be allowed to land us on the shore of a far-stretching Scepticism
illimitable to the mind's eye. And this seems to be the eminent
writer's own final opinion.<a name="FNanchor_123_151" id="FNanchor_123_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_151" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> So, too, it will always appear when the
case is fairly argued out; and that for the reasons adduced in our
text. The course of argument there pursued was adopted before the
Professor's book came to hand; but we have now added some extracts
from his pages in the shape of footnotes, and have given references to
other interesting topics touched upon by him.</p>

<p>For our purpose, however, it is necessary in some degree to disregard
the variety of those topics, and fix our attention upon the
conclusive issue. It is plain, that respecting our senses, as well as
our other primary sources of information, the limits of what we can
completely explain are very narrow. Yet each for himself and all of
us for our race must needs every day accept and act upon this limited
and imperfect kind of knowledge about what most essentially concerns
our actions as well as our speculations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>Several strong examples of such incompleteness are given by Helmholtz
in his scientific inquiry into the rationale of the visual sense-impressions.
We observe, for instance, in his chapter on Sensation
(p. 236 seq.) that all light-waves are the same in kind of movement,
but differ in size as widely as the ripples on a sea-beach (round which
happy children play) differ from the vast Atlantic ship-engulfing billows
sixty or a hundred feet apart. All these undulations are similar in
respect of reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, and polarisation,
as well as in their production of heat.<a name="FNanchor_124_152" id="FNanchor_124_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_152" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Now, it is the interpretation
of such movements into its own language by which our eye
gives us the sensation of colour. Yet this power of interpretation is
curiously limited&mdash;it does not appreciate the gentler ripples of the
light-waves&mdash;it does not reach to their mightier undulations. Consequently,
there may be tender colour-delicacies adorning the Universe,
completely incognisable by us, and there may be also glows and
intensities of light-beams magnificently resplendent, and unspeakably
grand in tone, of which we can through our visual apparatus form no
possible conception. Thus, our eye translates some waves into a
language which we call colour, but its scholarship is limited. A certain
number of signs it catches and interprets, the rest lie altogether outside
its ken. The Sun's softer light-harmonies, and his most awful
emanations of beauty remain equally unknown.</p>

<p>And another limitation has been imposed upon our optical apparatus.
For a perception of heating powers belonging to colour-waves
the eye refers us to the skin;&mdash;and as to their chemical powers we are
only just now discovering the instruments fitted for their true appreciation.</p>

<p>Skilful, too, and yet at the same time very skill-less, is the divination
into sunlight given us by our human eyes;&mdash;sunlight, that is to
say, as a general resultant in its whiteness. For, if our eyes, keen
and susceptible to us perfect clearness, attempt to analyze white light
into its factors and elements, their resolving faculty manifests still
more blank inabilities. And they fail also in examining certain
colours:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The most striking difference," writes Helmholtz, "between the
mixture of pigments and that of coloured light is, that while painters
make green by mixing blue and yellow pigments, the union of blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and yellow rays of light, produces white.... In general, then,
light, which consists of undulations of different wave-lengths, produces
different impressions upon our eye, namely, those of different
colours. But the number of hues which we can recognise is much
smaller than that of the various possible combinations of rays with
different wave-lengths which external objects can convey to our eyes.
The retina cannot distinguish between the white which is produced
by the union of scarlet and bluish-green light, and that which is composed
of yellowish-green and violet, or of yellow and ultramarine blue,
or of red, green, and violet, or of all the colours of the spectrum
united. All these combinations appear identically as white; and yet,
from a physical point of view, they are very different. In fact, the
only resemblance between the several combinations just mentioned is,
that they are indistinguishable to the human eye. For instance, a
surface illuminated with red and bluish-green light would come out
black in a photograph; while another lighted with yellowish-green
and violet would appear very bright, although both surfaces alike
seem to the eye to be simply white. Again, if we successively illuminate
coloured objects with white beams of light of various composition,
they will appear differently coloured. And whenever we decompose
two such beams by a prism, or look at them through a coloured
glass, the difference between them at once becomes evident.</p>

<p>"Other colours, also, especially when they are not strongly pronounced,
may, like pure white light, be composed of very different
mixtures, and yet appear indistinguishable to the eye, while in every
other property, physical or chemical, they are entirely distinct."
(pp. 239-241.)</p>

<p>We may speak of visual Sensation, then, as a <em>limited</em> power of
<em>translating</em> light. And what relation does visual <em>Perception</em> bear to
this Power? Probably the simplest way of expressing it, is to say
that it is neither more nor less than the <em>translation of a translation</em>.
The mind thus construes to itself what the visual sense is every
moment busied with expressing in its own special language&mdash;the interpretation
of movement, into colour, light and shadow. And from
these data&mdash;these colours, lights and shadows, the mind draws its
own inferences.</p>

<p>Now these inferences thus drawn from preceding Sense inferences,&mdash;limited
in range, as we have seen, and defective in analytic power;&mdash;these
inferences, such as they are, constitute the boasted certainty
of eyesight; and of all things apprehended by its means,&mdash;all</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">&mdash;quæ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus et quæ</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Ipse sibi <em>tradit</em> spectator.</span></div>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>
<p>It needs but a statement of the mode in which our final mind-interpretations
are constructed,&mdash;of these translated translations,&mdash;obscure
in grammar and imperfect in vocabulary&mdash;to prove how very
difficult is the position of the Realist. In view of this Empire of the
Unknowable proclaimed by Science over the surest of our perceiving
powers, the firmest foundations of our experimental knowledge,
Helmholtz suggests that his reader "may feel determined to stick
fast to the 'sound common sense' of mankind, and believe his own
senses more than physiology." (p. 270.)</p>

<p>And such, no doubt, is the conclusion of the matter to the greater
part of mankind. But we will in the first place prefer hearing the
last word of the physiologist. From page 270 to page 313 of his
work, he argues out the great question of <em>how</em> we perceive under
the full impression of its vast importance to psychology, metaphysics,
and the first principles upon which all science and all reasonings
repose. "We have," he says (p. 281), "already learned enough to
see that the questions which have here to be decided are of fundamental
importance, not only for the physiology of sight, but for a
correct understanding of the true nature and limits of human knowledge
generally."</p>

<p>The Physiologist's last word is this&mdash;Sense impressions are signs,
the meaning of which we learn inductively by a process of self
education. "Illusions obviously depend upon mental processes which
may be described as false inductions.... There appears to me to
be in reality only a superficial difference between the 'conclusions' of
logicians and those inductive conclusions of which we recognise the
result in the conceptions we gain of the outer world through our
sensations. The difference chiefly depends upon the former conclusions
being capable of expression in words, while the latter are not;
because, instead of words, they only deal with sensations and the
memory of sensations. Indeed, it is just the impossibility of describing
sensations, whether actual or remembered, in words, which makes
it so difficult to discuss this department of psychology at all."
(pp. 307, 8.) And again (p. 314), "There is a most striking analogy
between the entire range of processes which we have been discussing,
and another System of Signs, which is not given by nature but arbitrarily
chosen, and which must undoubtedly be learned before it is
understood. I mean the words of our mother tongue.</p>

<p>"Learning how to speak is obviously a much more difficult task than
acquiring a foreign language in after-life. First, the child has to guess
that the sounds it hears are intended to be signs at all; next, the
meaning of each separate sound must be found out, by the same kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of induction as the meaning of the sensations of sight or touch; and
yet we see children by the end of their first year already understanding
certain words and phrases, even if they are not yet able to repeat
them. We may sometimes observe the same in dogs.</p>

<p>"Now this connection between Names and Objects, which demonstrably
must be <em>learnt</em>, becomes just as firm and indestructible as that
between Sensations and the Objects which produce them. We cannot
help thinking of the usual signification of a word, even when it is
used exceptionally in some other sense; we cannot help feeling the
mental emotions which a fictitious narrative calls forth, even when we
know that it is not true; just in the same way as we cannot get rid
of the normal signification of the sensations produced by any illusion
of the senses, even when we know that they are not real.</p>

<p>"There is one other point of comparison which is worth notice.
The elementary signs of language are only twenty-six letters, and yet
what wonderfully varied meanings can we express and communicate
by their combination! Consider, in comparison with this, the enormous
number of elementary signs with which the machinery of sight
is provided. We may take the number of fibres in the optic nerves
as two hundred and fifty thousand. Each of these is capable of
innumerable different degrees of sensation of one, two, or three primary
colours. It follows that it is possible to construct an immeasurably
greater number of combinations here than with the few letters
which build up our words. Nor must we forget the extremely rapid
changes of which the images of sight are capable. No wonder, then,
if our senses speak to us in language which can express far more
delicate distinctions and richer varieties than can be conveyed by
words."</p>

<p>Finally (pp. 315, 16), "The correspondence, therefore, between
the external world and the Perceptions of Sight rests, either in whole
or in part, upon the same foundation as all our knowledge of the
actual world,&mdash;on <em>experience</em>, and on constant <em>verification</em> of its accuracy
by experiments which we perform with every movement of our
body. It follows, of course, that we are only warranted in accepting
the reality of this correspondence so far as these means of verification
extend, which is really as far as for practical purposes we need.</p>

<p>"Beyond these limits, as, for example, in the region of Qualities,
we are in some instances able to prove conclusively that there is no
correspondence at all between sensations and their objects.</p>

<p>"Only the relations of time, of space, of equality, and those which
are derived from them, of number, size, regularity of co-existence
and of sequence&mdash;'mathematical relations' in short, are common to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the outer and the inner world, and here we may indeed look for a
complete correspondence between our conceptions and the objects
which excite them.</p>

<p>"But it seems to me that we should not quarrel with the bounty of
nature because the greatness, and also the emptiness, of these abstract
relations have been concealed from us by the manifold brilliance of a
system of signs; since thus they can be the more easily surveyed and
used for practical ends, while yet traces enough remain visible to guide
the philosophical spirit aright, in its search after the meaning of sensible
Images and Signs."</p>

<p>Let therefore this account of visual Perception be accepted by us,
as it will probably be by three-fourths of scientific men throughout
Europe. And, next, let us ask, as every real thinker will proceed to
ask, on <em>what</em> grounds of <em>certitude</em> rests our assurance as regards the
daily and hourly information received through this avenue of perception,
reasoned and acted upon with unswerving confidence by us all?</p>

<p>For an examination of the ground principle of Induction, the reader
must be referred to our next chapter. But it is at once clear that no
human <em>experience</em> can possess the attribute of universality, otherwise
it would cease to be human. We have then in this present appeal to
the veracity of Experience, no <em>absolute</em> knowledge to deal with, only
knowledge as relative to mankind. Nay, we must go a little further
still in our limitation, and say to the <em>generality</em> of mankind. For our
eyes do not all see perfectly alike&mdash;a North-American Indian sees
what a Cockney cannot discover; the trained eye discerns differently
from the untrained. On the differences of power in eye and ear rest
the differences in many kinds of theorising&mdash;amongst which art-perceptions
yield an obvious and familiar set of examples. And if we
try for a more precise estimate of the value of our limited human
relativity, and proceed by way of comparison between <em>our own</em> diverse
endowments, who shall venture to say that the eye of our body interpreted
by our understanding, tells our inmost self more truly than the
eye of our human soul, informing us directly of the facts of its intuitive
vision? So far as our actual means of valuing these two modes
of beholding can go, there is no knowledge so perfect as the product
of pure intuition, the glorious fabric of Mathematical Science. And
to pure Science it matters not whether the requisite Schematism is
drawn upon a sheet of white paper or on the clear tablet of the
imagining faculty of a philosopher. The purely inward view is in
truth generally the farthest reaching, and the most unclouded. When,
therefore, it is, and has been for centuries, apparent to the inmost eye
of the generality of our race that there <em>really</em> exists a spiritual world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
within themselves&mdash;above them, and in the far distant future beyond
us all, permanent while we change, and the evidence of our own ultimate
permanency,&mdash;such knowledge may undeniably be human, the
very flower and distinction of our human nature; and it may on that
account be received by us as true.</p>

<p>If, again, our ordinary human soul is so far a Christian as to
exclaim with Tertullian, "O good God," by what logical process
shall we confute its utterance, while we maintain the utterance of our
commonest sense-perceptions?</p>

<p>That we all see in frames, that we all think in frames, no rational
thinker or perceiver will deny. If, however, any of us chooses to be
an Idealist or Nihilist, let him at least be consistent;&mdash;if he will assert
the necessity of Doubt, let him maintain its empire by doubting his
own assertion. But let no man think that Doubt leads him any
whither except to an abnegation of thought, a mistrust alike of Sense
and Soul, and an abdication of every human prerogative:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Thy hand, great Anarch, lets the curtain fall,</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">And universal Darkness buries all."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>So sang the witty rhymer, but we may add in prose that Doubt if
thoroughly real, invariably commits suicide, and becomes first doubtful,
after that, a non-entity at last.</p>


<h4><a id="C.3"></a>C.&mdash;HELMHOLTZ ON SPECIALTIES OF SENSIBILITY.</h4>

<p>The following passages from this interesting writer will be found in
his Chapter "on the Sensations of Sight," between pp. 232 and 236.
They will, it is hoped, be thoroughly intelligible if read in connection
with the part of our last Chapter (pp. 158, 9) where a reference to
this note was made.</p>

<p>"The nerve-fibres have been often compared with telegraphic wires
traversing a country, and the comparison is well fitted to illustrate
this striking and important peculiarity of their mode of action. In
the network of telegraphs we find everywhere the same copper or iron
wires carrying the same kind of movement, a stream of electricity,
but producing the most different results in the various stations according
to the auxiliary apparatus with which they are connected. At one
station the effect is the ringing of a bell, at another a signal is moved,
and at a third a recording instrument is set to work.... Nerve-fibres
and telegraphic wires are equally striking examples to illustrate
the doctrine that the same causes may, under different conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
produce different results.... As motor nerves, when irritated,
produce movement, because they are connected with muscles, and
glandular nerves secretion, because they lead to glands, so do sensitive
nerves, when they are irritated, produce sensation, because they are
connected with sensitive organs.... Whether by the irritation
of a nerve we produce a muscular movement, a secretion or a sensation
depends upon whether we are handling a motor, a glandular, or a
sensitive nerve, and not at all upon what means of irritation we may
use. It may be an electrical shock, or tearing the nerve, or cutting it
through, or moistening it with a solution of salt, or touching it with a
hot wire. In the same way (and this great step in advance was due
to Johannes Müller) the <em>kind</em> of sensation which will ensue when we
irritate a sensitive nerve, whether an impression of light, or of sound,
or of feeling, or of smell, or of taste, will be produced, depends
entirely upon which sense the excited nerve subserves, and not at all
upon the method of excitation we adopt.</p>

<p>"Let us now apply this to the optic nerve, which is the object of
our present enquiry. In the first place, we know that no kind of
action upon any part of the body except the eye and the nerve which
belongs to it, can ever produce the sensation of light. The stories of
somnambulists, which are the only arguments that can be adduced
against this belief, we may be allowed to disbelieve. But, on the
other hand, it is not light alone which can produce the sensation of
light upon the eye, but also any other power which can excite the
optic nerve. If the weakest electrical currents are passed through the
eye they produce flashes of light. A blow, or even a slight pressure
made upon the side of the eyeball with the finger, makes an impression
of light in the darkest room, and, under favourable circumstances,
this may become intense. In these cases it is important to remember
that there is no objective light produced in the retina, as some of the
older physiologists assumed, for the sensation of light may be so
strong that a second observer could not fail to see through the pupil
the illumination of the retina which would follow, if the sensation were
really produced by an actual development of light within the eye.
But nothing of the sort has ever been seen. Pressure or the electric
current excites the optic nerve, and therefore, according to Müller's
law, a sensation of light results, but under these circumstances, at
least, there is not the smallest spark of actual light.</p>

<p>"In the same way, increased pressure of blood, its abnormal constitution
in fevers, or its contamination with intoxicating or narcotic
drugs, can produce sensations of light to which no actual light corresponds.
Even in cases in which an eye is entirely lost by accident or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
by an operation, the irritation of the stump of the optic nerve while
it is healing is capable of producing similar subjective effects. It
follows from these facts that the peculiarity in kind which distinguishes
the sensation of light from all others, does not depend upon any peculiar
qualities of light itself. Every action which is capable of exciting
the optic nerve is capable of producing the impression of light; and
the purely subjective sensation thus produced is so precisely similar
to that caused by external light, that persons unacquainted with these
phenomena readily suppose that the rays they see are real objective
beams.</p>

<p>"Thus we see that external light produces no other effects in the
optic nerve than other agents of an entirely different nature. In one
respect only does light differ from the other causes which are capable
of exciting this nerve: namely, that the retina, being placed at the
back of the firm globe of the eye, and further protected by the bony
orbit, is almost entirely withdrawn from other exciting agents, and
is thus only exceptionally affected by them, while it is continually
receiving the rays of light which stream in upon it through the
transparent media of the eye.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, the optic nerve, by reason of the peculiar
structures in connection with the ends of its fibres, the rods and cones
of the retina, is incomparably more sensitive to rays of light than
any other nervous apparatus of the body, since the rest can only be
affected by rays which are concentrated enough to produce noticeable
elevation of temperature.</p>

<p>"This explains why the sensations of the optic nerve are for us the
ordinary sensible sign of the presence of light in the field of vision,
and why we always connect the sensation of light with light itself, even
where they are really unconnected. But we must never forget that a
survey of all the facts in their natural connection puts it beyond doubt
that external light is only <em>one</em> of the exciting causes capable of bringing
the optic nerve into functional activity, and therefore that there is no
exclusive relation between the sensation of light and light itself."</p>

<p>Some of the quotations just made direct attention to illusions of
Sight which (as we have seen in our last note) Helmholtz elsewhere
calls "false inductions." Now one curious fact relative to these impressions
is that in many instances the objective consequent is due to
a subjective antecedent. Some readers may like to peruse a short
account of five variously caused sight-illusions taken from an Oration
on <em>Positivism</em> delivered by the present writer at St. George's Hall in
May 1871. The particulars here given of the fifth illusion should be
compared with the foot-note on page 158 <i>ante</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will mention five instances in which people believe they see something,
and do not see it; in other words, the objective antecedent is
wanting, and the impression is produced partly by the sensory apparatus,
partly by the mind itself. As I describe these instances one
by one, let my hearers ask themselves, How does this illusion come
about? Is it produced by our optic instrument or by our mental
activity?</p>

<p>"First, then, Take a lighted stick, and whirl it rapidly round and
round. You believe you see a circle of sparks&mdash;in reality it is no
more than a simple train, and on a like illusion the Catherine-wheel is
constructed. Again, put yourself in the hands of an optically inclined
friend, and let him operate upon you thus. He shall place a cardboard
down the middle axis of your face, quite close against your
nose&mdash;one side of his board, say the right, coloured a brilliant red,
the left a vivid green. After an instant or two let him suddenly substitute
another board, white on both sides. Do my young friends
guess what will follow? Your right eye will see green, your left red&mdash;the
reverse of what they saw before; yet neither will see correctly,
for both eyes are looking at uncoloured surfaces.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, Watch the full moon rising&mdash;how large and round she
looks, resting as it were upon that eastern hill, and seen amidst the
tops of its forest trees! How much larger and broader than when
she hangs aloft in upper sky! Has every one here learned the true
reason why? If not, look at her through a slit in a card, and her
diameter will be the same.</p>

<p>"Fourthly, A schoolboy is crossing his bedroom in the deep dark
night, anxiously hoping that his head may not come into collision with
the bed-post. Though carefully and successfully avoiding it, he imagines
of a sudden that the blow is imminent. Quick as thought he
stops to save his head, and, behold, the room is as quickly filled with
sparks or flames of fire. Another moment, and all becomes dark once
more. I have heard many a schoolboy exclaim over this phenomenon,
but never knew one who could explain it. Finally, did you ever, on
opening your eyes in a morning, close them quickly again, and keep
them shut, directing them as if to look straight forwards? Most persons
of active nervous power, after a few trials&mdash;say a dozen, or a
score&mdash;are surprised to see colours appear and flit before the sight.
Some years ago, Germany's greatest poet tried, at the suggestion of
her greatest physiologist, a series of experiments on these coloured
images. He found that by an effort of will he could cause them to
come and go, govern their movement, march, and succession. And
this took place under no conditions of impaired sensation, nor any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
hallucination of a diseased mind. A thoroughly healthy will succeeded
in impressing itself upon physical instruments, controlling
their law, and creating at its own pleasure an unfailingly bright
phantasmagoria.</p>

<p>"Some here may, others may not, have apprehended the distinctions
between our five cases. The first two are due to the sensory apparatus,
its optical laws of continued impression and complementary
colour. In the latter three, mind intervenes. The enlarged size of
the moon occurs through rapid comparison, the fiery lights in a dark
room through instinctive apprehension, both influences of mind on
the sensory system. The fifth and most interesting of all is no bad
example of interference between moral and material law. The will
truly causative (you may remark) overrules the natural process of
physical impression, alters it, and creates a designed effect. I wish I
could induce my young friends to devise a number of experiments on
similar mixed cases, and, having tried them, to dissect out their
real laws. These sharpenings of the critical faculty are exceedingly
useful&mdash;they cultivate clearness; and most people know that two-thirds
among our mistakes in life are caused by confusion of thought.</p>

<p>"Besides all other uses, such lessons teach at once the necessity, as
we said before, of observing your own observations. And as, first,
the real witness of every observation is our mind; every fact which
comes through our bodily senses being to us a mental impression, it
seems but common sense to hear above all things what mind has to
say for and about itself. Then, secondly, where would be the benefit
derived from our observations, if we could not reason upon them, or
could place no confidence in our own reasonings? Yet the art of
reasoning is so purely a mental process, that it can be represented by
symbols as abstract and free from material meaning as if they were
bare algebraic signs. Thirdly, in the most accurate of sciences mind
extends our knowledge far beyond the circle of observation, and gives
us axiomatic assurance of its own accuracy. Who ever saw, or ever
can see, all straight lines in all conceivable positions, yet who doubts
that throughout the whole universe no two straight lines ever did
inclose or can inclose a space? And, fourthly, can it be a matter of
indifference to any of us what evidence the mind offers concerning its
own moral nature, and what is the value of that evidence, and the
laws deducible therefrom? How true it thus appears that 'know
thyself' lies at the root of all knowledge, and that the man who
receives no witness from within can know nothing as he ought to
know it!"</p>

<h4><a id="D.3"></a>D.&mdash;POPULAR ACCOUNT OF PURE IDEALISM WITH
CRITICAL REMARKS.</h4>

<p>"A classification of systems of philosophy according to the cosmological
conceptions governing them has actually been made. It is
founded on a consideration of the differences among philosophers as
to what that totality of existence is which is to be accepted as really
vouched for by Mind. All agree, as we have said, that Mind is the
sole voucher for anything; but philosophers are divisible into schools
according to the various views they have taken of the constitution of
that phenomenal Universe, that Cosmos, that total round of things,
of which we have a recurring assurance in every act of perception,
and which is orbed forth more or less fully for each man in his wider
contemplations.</p>

<p>"The popular or habitual conception of mankind in general is that
there are two distinct worlds mixed up in the phenomenal Cosmos&mdash;a
world of Mind, consisting of multitudes of individual minds, and a
world of Matter, consisting of all the extended immensity and variety
of material objects. Neither of these worlds is thought of as begotten
of the other, but each of them as existing independently in its own
proper nature and within its own definite bounds, though they traffic
with each other at present. Sweep away all existing minds, and the
deserted Earth would continue to spin round all the same, still whirling
its rocks, trees, clouds, and all the rest of its material pomp and
garniture, alternately in the sunshine and in the depths of the starry
stillness. Though no eye should behold, and no ear should hear,
there would be evenings of silver moonlight on the ocean-marge, and
the waves would roar as they broke and retired. On the other hand,
suppose the entire fabric of the material Universe abolished and dissolved,
and the dishoused population of spirits would still somehow
survive in the imaginable vacancy. If this second notion is not so
easy or common as the first, it still virtually belongs to the popular
conception of the contents or constitution of the Cosmos. The conception
is that of a Natural Dualism, or of the contact in every act of
perception of two distinct spheres, one an internal perceiving mind,
and the other an external world composed of the actual and identical
objects which this mind perceives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the first exercise of philosophic thought, however, this conception
is blurred. An immense quantity of what we all instinctively
think of as really existing out of ourselves turns out, on investigation,
not to exist at all as we fancy it existing, but to consist only of affections
of the perceiving mind. The redness of the rose is not a real
external thing, immutably the same in itself; it is only a certain peculiar
action on my physiology which the presence of an external cause
or object seems to determine. Were my physiology different, the
action would be different, though the cause or object remained the
same. Indeed, there <em>are</em> persons in whom the presence of a rose
occasions no sensation of redness such as is known to me, but a much
vaguer sensation, not distinguishable from what I should at once distinguish
as greenness. And, as colour is thus at once detected as no
external independently-existing reality, but only a recurring physiological
affection of myself and other sentient beings like myself, so
with a thousand other things which, by habit or instinct, I suppose as
externally and independently existing. When I imagine the depopulated
Earth still wheeling its inanimate rotundity through the daily
sunshine and the nocturnal shadow, or one of its bays still resonant
in moonlit evenings with the roar of the breaking waves, it is because,
in spite of myself, I intrude into the fancy the supposition of a listening
ear, and a beholding eye analogous to my own. It is only by a
strong effort that I can realize that a great deal at least of what I thus
think of as the goings-on of things by themselves is not and cannot
be their goings-on by themselves, but consists at the utmost of effects
interbred between them and a particular sentiency in the midst of
them. But the effort may be made; and, when it is made repeatedly,
in a great many directions, and with reference to a great many of the
so-called properties of matter, the inevitable result for the philosophic
mind is that the popularly-imagined substance of a real external world
finds itself eaten away or corroded, at least to a certain depth. So
far philosophers are agreed. It is when they proceed to consider to
<em>what</em> depth the popularly-imagined substance of the real external
world is thus eaten away, or accounted for, that they begin to differ.</p>

<p>"Some philosophers, departing as little as may be from the popular
judgment, suppose that, however much of the apparent external world
may be resolved into affections of the subjective sentiency, there still
remains an objective residue of such primary qualities as extension,
figure, divisibility, mobility, etc., belonging to external matter itself,
and by the direct and immediate cognizance of which the mind is
brought face to face with external substance, and knows something of
its real goings-on. Philosophers of this school are known generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
as <span class="smcap">Realists</span>. More numerous, however, are those who, not allowing
an objective and independent reality even to the so-called primary
qualities of matter, but believing them as well as colour, odour, or
savour, to be only affections of the sentiency, deny that the mind is
in any sense brought face to face with real external things such as
they seem in the act of perception. To thinkers of this school there
has been given the general name of <span class="smcap">Idealists</span>. This broad distinction
of Philosophers cosmologically into <span class="smcap">Realists</span> and <span class="smcap">Idealists</span> is so far
convenient enough. Cosmologically, or in respect of this present
Universe of ours, with its dualism of Mind and Matter, every man
must declare himself either a <span class="smcap">Realist</span> or an <span class="smcap">Idealist</span>, if he understands
the meanings attached to these terms. The distinction has
reference solely to his notion of the so-called external or material
world in its relations to the perceiving mind. If he abides, though
only in part, by the popular conception, and regards the material
world as a substantial reality independent of the perceiving mind, and
which the mind, according to its powers, presses against and directly
apprehends in every act of perception, then he is a <span class="smcap">Realist</span>. If, on
the other hand, he cannot see that there need be asserted any external
material world with such characters as we attribute to it, but supposes
that our unanimous agreement in the imagination of such an external
world is merely a habit of our own sentiency, projecting its own ideas
or affections outwards, and giving them a body, then he is an <span class="smcap">Idealist</span>."
Masson, "<cite>Recent British Philosophy</cite>," pp. 58-64. Again p. 69, seq.,
"There is the system of <em>Constructive Idealism</em>. It may be so called
to distinguish it from the more developed and extreme Idealism
presently to be spoken of. According to this system, we do not
perceive the real external world immediately, but only mediately&mdash;that
is, the objects which we take as the things actually perceived are
not the real objects at all, but only vicarious assurances, representatives,
or nuntii of real unknown objects. The hills, the rocks, the
trees, the stars, all the choir of heaven and earth, are not, in any of
their qualities, primary, secondary, or whatever we choose to call
them, the actual existences out of us, but only the addresses of a
'something' to our physiology, or eductions by our physiology out
of a 'something.' They are all Thoughts or Ideas, with only this
peculiarity involved in them, that they will not rest in themselves, but
compel a reference to objects out of self, with which, by some arrangement
or other, they stand in relation. Difficult as this system may be
to understand, and violently as it wrenches the popular common sense,
it is yet the system into which the great majority of philosophers in
all ages and countries hitherto are seen, more or less distinctly, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
have been carried by their speculations. While the Natural Realists
among philosophers have been very few, and even these have been
Realists in a sense unintelligible to the popular mind, quite a host
of philosophers have been Constructive Idealists. These might be
farther subdivided according to particular variations in the form of
their Idealism. Thus, there have been many Constructive Idealists
who have regarded the objects rising to the mind in external perception,
and taken to be representative of real unknown objects, as
something more than modifications of the mind itself&mdash;as having
their origin without. Among these have been reckoned Malebranche,
Berkeley, Clarke, Sir Isaac Newton, Tucker, and possibly Locke.
But there have been other Constructive Idealists, who have supposed
the objects rising in the mind in external perception to be only
modifications of the mind itself, but yet, by some arrangement,
vicarious of real unknown objects, and intimating their existence.
Among such have been reckoned Descartes, Leibnitz, Condillac, Kant,
and most Platonists. The general name 'Idealists' it will be seen
properly enough includes both the classes as distinct from the Natural
Realists, inasmuch as both classes hold that what the mind is directly
cognizant of in external perception is only ideas. But, inasmuch as
these ideas are held by both classes, though under divers hypotheses,
to refer to real existences beyond themselves, and distinct from the
perceiving mind, the thinkers in question may also properly enough
be called Realists or Dualists, though not 'Natural' Realists or
Dualists. They occupy a midway place between the Natural Realists
and the philosophers next to be mentioned.</p>

<p>"There is the system of <em>Pure Idealism</em>, which abolishes matter as a
distinct or independent existence in any sense, and resolves it completely
into mind. Though this system is named in the scheme, for
the sake of symmetry, and as the exact antithesis to Materialism,
it is difficult to cite representatives that could be certainly discriminated
from the merely Constructive Idealists just mentioned on
the one hand, and from the school of philosophers next following
on the other. Fichte is, perhaps, the purest example." <cite>Ibid.</cite> pp.
69-72.</p>

<p>For perfect clearness we must put together two other passages
from Professor Masson's interesting volume:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is the system of <em>Nihilism</em>, or, as it may be better called,
<em>Non-Substantialism</em>. According to this system, the Phænomenal
Cosmos, whether regarded as consisting of two parallel successions
of phænomena (Mind and Matter), or of only one (Mind or Matter),
resolves itself, on analysis, into an absolute Nothingness,&mdash;mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
appearances with no credible substratum of Reality; a play of
phantasms in a void. If there have been no positive or dogmatic
Nihilists, yet both Hume for one purpose, and Fichte for another,
have propounded Nihilism as the ultimate issue of all reasoning that
does not start with some <i lang="la">à priori</i> postulate." Masson, "<cite>Recent British
Philosophy</cite>," p. 66.... If any one could assert "There
is no Absolute," surely it might be the Nihilist, who has analysed
away both Matter and Thought, and attenuated the Cosmos into
vapour and non-significance. Yet, from the abyss of a speculatively
reasoned Nihilism more void than Hume's, Fichte returned, by a
convulsive act of soul,&mdash;which he termed <em>faith</em>&mdash;an intense, a
burning, a blazing Ontologist. <cite>Ibid.</cite> p. 81."<a name="FNanchor_125_153" id="FNanchor_125_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_153" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>This is certainly an eloquent account of philosophic Idealism as it
may in its various phases be represented to the world of general
readers. It turns, as every such speculation must turn, on the great
principle, that our Sensations are so many series of signs and symbols.<a name="FNanchor_126_154" id="FNanchor_126_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_154" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
They may be preordained, and our apprehension of them innate;&mdash;they
may be arbitrary, and their interpretation the work of man's
intelligence. To decide this question, is to decide something as to
the extent of their <em>relativity</em>; but will any one pronounce their
information absolutely true?</p>

<p>At this point occurs a wide divergence between two great schools
of Idealism&mdash;the Psychological, and the Theological thinkers. These
schools inosculate in respect of some of their arguments, and of
their objections against ordinary modes of thought. They disagree,
however, in their aims&mdash;the ports at which they land themselves
and their disciples.</p>

<p>Psychological Idealism is best known to most readers through
Mr. J. S. Mill. The Theological view, so far as this country goes,
seems to have made scant progress beyond Berkeley and a few of his
clever followers. For ordinary Englishmen, a reference to continental
writers on this question seems useless;&mdash;Theology being discussed
by them in so <i lang="la">ab extrâ</i> a manner as to put them out of court with
even the most metaphysical of our theologians.</p>

<p>Regarding the subject in a psychological light, Mr. O'Hanlon made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the following common-sense remarks amongst others of a more
abstract nature:<a name="FNanchor_127_155" id="FNanchor_127_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_155" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"To come now to Mr. Mill's Idealism. He, as all the world of
thinkers knows, following the steps of Berkeley and Hume, claims,
by means of his power of analysis, and by the aid of the formidable
psychological instrument furnished him by the doctrine of the Association
of Ideas, to have got rid of all other existences save and
except states of consciousness, actual and possible.... I
propose to try and answer his arguments" (<i>i.e.</i> within certain
expressed limitations)&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let A = all my sensations.</p>

<p>" B = the group of sensations and of permanent possibilities
of sensation I call my body.</p>

<p>" C = the group of permanent possibilities of sensation I call
my friend Smith.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Now I find B always related to A in a very peculiar manner. B
has in perpetual conjunction with it a long series of manifold states
of consciousness, A. C resembles B in very many particulars, but it
is not so related to A. I hence conclude, if I follow Mr. Mill, that
C is so related to some other A, that is, to some other consciousness.
In drawing this conclusion, in extending to C, which so closely
resembles B, my experience of B, I, according to Mr. Mill, do but
extend the principles of inductive evidence, which experience shews
hold good of my states of consciousness, to <em>a sphere without my
consciousness</em>."</p>

<p>The italicized words sound simple enough to the ordinary reader,
but argument upon them involves (as Mr. O'Hanlon observes) two
serious postulates. "(a) That there is a sphere beyond my consciousness;
the very thing to be proved, (b) That the laws, which obtain
in my consciousness, also obtain in the sphere beyond it." But;&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Such an inference'" he goes on to quote from Mill "'would
only be warrantable if we could know <i lang="la">à priori</i> that we must have
been created capable of conceiving whatever is capable of existing:
that the universe of thought and that of reality, the microcosm and
the macrocosm (as they once were called) must have been framed in
complete correspondence with one another. That this is really the
case has been laid down expressly by some systems of philosophy,
by implication in more, and is the foundation (among others) of the
systems of Schelling and Hegel; but <em>an assumption</em> more destitute of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
evidence could scarcely be made, nor can one easily imagine any
evidence that could prove it unless it were revealed from above.'"
Mill on Hamilton, chap. VI. p. 65.</p>

<p>The reader will probably see at once where the abstract difficulty
lies, and how it runs up into the higher metaphysics.</p>

<p>Now, as Mr. O'Hanlon puts the case, taking all this for granted;</p>

<p>"A boy cuts his finger and screams.... Yet if I was
not by, the boy, the knife, the blood, the scream, would only exist
potentially."</p>

<p>Or on the other hand if I sacrifice consistency and substitute
'actually' for 'potentially,' "I thereby reject the validity of the
Psychological method" which asserts "that the belief in an external
cause of our sensations" is not original but "generated 'so early as
to have become inseparable from our consciousness before the time
at which memory commences.' ... Nevertheless, it afterwards
admits that the belief in the case of persons, has an external
cause. Hereby the method commits suicide, falsus in uno, falsus in
omnibus."</p>

<p>Finally, he remarks, "the psychological method professes very
little regard for our natural beliefs. Now I can, by a vigorous effort,
regard matter as mere states or possible states of my consciousness
(at least I can do so for the moment), but I can also look on other
persons in the same light. Why should one natural belief be treated
more tenderly than another?... In short, if I refuse to
postulate a <em>non ego</em>, and if I hold that, supposing the states of consciousness
I call the <em>ego</em> can be shewn capable of producing the notion
of the <em>non ego</em>, then they did produce it, and if I hold that they can
be shewn to be so capable, such a theory is equally applicable to
external consciousnesses as to external matter. In both cases, I cannot
get out of the sphere of my own feelings; there may be something
beyond or there may not, but if there is, it is at all events incognisable
by me, and to all intents and purposes I am alone in the universe."<a name="FNanchor_128_156" id="FNanchor_128_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_156" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>In drift and true meaning Bishop Berkeley's Idealism differed <i lang="la">toto cælo</i>
from Mill's, as well as from Hume's idealistic Scepticism. His belief
in a world outside us all was as firm as that of the firmest Realist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and by a world outside us he meant a world which neither we nor
our conceptions can alter. His reasoning was also of the most
common-sense description. Sensation is (as before said) a <em>sign</em>
between us and things outside. But the sign tells us nothing of
any <em>substratum</em> on which the things signified depend for their sign-giving
powers. Matter (as commonly understood<a name="FNanchor_129_157" id="FNanchor_129_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_157" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>) is a figment
devised by certain philosophers;&mdash;the true subsistence of the outward
world is in and for mind, and apart from thought it does not subsist
at all. But my mind, nay the human mind, is limited. There is
One whose thoughts are not as our thoughts;&mdash;in Him the world
subsists, and in Him we also have our Being continually. The world
is what it is to us, in and through Him, and it appeals not to our
so-called material frames but to our minds.</p>

<p>Berkeley's argument was simply this. Take away gross matter&mdash;and
the world is still perfectly Real. It is real because God is real.
Real for us, real in Him; and by this we <em>know</em> His Reality.<a name="FNanchor_130_158" id="FNanchor_130_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_158" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>
<p>By comparing this phase of Idealism with the modern doctrine of
what is called the "Conditioned," its Theological interest becomes
still more obvious. Suppose we naturally know only what is conditioned
(<i>i.e.</i> dependent on some Absolute reality to us unknown),
what ought, asks Dr. Mansel, to be the inference? The right
inference is that the Divine Absolute did not leave our world in
ignorance, but did really reveal Himself to Man.</p>

<p>The fate of arguments framed in special interests, however noble
those interests may be, is usually the same. Some clever antagonist
allows their destructive force, but refuses their affirmative conclusions.
Berkeley's denial of the unknown substratum called matter was
approved by sceptics, who scoffed at his unknown God. His idealism
was pronounced unanswerable, his divinity needed no answer. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>fore,
the Reason remained without satisfaction of any kind, "Most
of the writings" says Hume "of that very ingenious author form the
best lessons of scepticism which are to be found either among the
ancient or modern philosophers, Bayle not excepted. He professes,
however, in his title-page (and undoubtedly with great truth,) to have
composed his book against the sceptics as well as against the atheists
and freethinkers. But that all his arguments, though otherwise
intended, are, in reality, merely sceptical, appears from this, <em>that they
admit of no answer, and produce no conviction</em>." (<cite>Inquiry concerning
the Human Understanding.</cite> Section XII.) And be it remarked that
this final clause forms a skilled definition of Scepticism&mdash;its essential
notion&mdash;given by an expert. Dean Mansel himself who left at his
death an unfinished article upon Berkeley, suffered under a charge of
promoting what he desired to discourage. So dangerous is it to deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
with wide questions by narrowing their sweep to a point; yet on the
other hand how few students are prepared to read and think widely?</p>

<p>Shall we attribute to a growing width of Thought, the increased
breadth of view under which Idealism has of late years been represented?
The German Philosopher, with whom Schwegler closes his
philosophic history writes "This ideality or non-substantiality of the
finite is the chief maxim of philosophy; and for that reason every true
philosophy is idealistic" (Idealismus).<a name="FNanchor_131_159" id="FNanchor_131_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_159" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> In England Mr. Green of
Balliol signalises Berkeley's "true proposition&mdash;there is nothing real
apart from thought&mdash;" and carefully distinguishes it from the one so
often substituted for it&mdash;the fatal flaw of the Berkeleian argument.<a name="FNanchor_132_160" id="FNanchor_132_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_160" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
Another influential thinker, Mr. Herbert Spencer,&mdash;who, like Professor
Huxley, uses materialistic symbols treating them as symbols
only,&mdash;has been for some time labouring after a "reconciliation of
Realism and Idealism," which again is considered by an able critic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Mr. Henry Sidgwick, "an impossible compromise."&mdash;Mr. Spencer's
answer to Mr. Sidgwick, on this particular point, will be found in
his recently published volume of "Essays" (III. 282 seq.). A very
instructive sentence occurs on p. 290. "Should it be said that this
regarding of everything constituting experience and thought as symbolic,
has a very shadowy aspect; I reply that these which I speak
of as symbols, are real relatively to our consciousness; and are
symbolic only in their relation to the Ultimate Reality."</p>

<p>So much then for a question which in a variety of shapes has
exercised the human intellect throughout countless generations, and
in all countries from India to the United States. It has also pervaded
all spheres of Thought from physical science, (on which compare
further, Additional Note I., and our next chapter), to the great philosophico-theological
domain as we have already seen in certain specimens
of Western thought. It would be easy to illustrate its empire
far more extensively from those wonderful Eastern systems brought
home to English readers thirty-six years ago by the translation of
Ritters' Ancient Philosophy, but very imperfectly comprehended even
now, notwithstanding the agreeable reception which Professor Max
Müller has provided for them. To his writings we will gladly refer
the curious student.</p>


<h4><a id="E.3"></a>E.&mdash;ON THE RELATIONS OF FACT AND THEORY.</h4>

<p>"The distinction between Theory (that is, true Theory) and Fact
is this: that in Theory the Ideas are considered as distinct from the
Facts: in Facts, though Ideas may be involved, they are not, in our
apprehension, separated from the sensations. In a Fact, the Ideas
are applied so readily and familiarly, and incorporated with the sensations
so entirely, that we do not see <em>them</em>, we see <em>through them</em>. A
person who carefully notes the motion of a star all night, sees the
circle which it describes as he sees the star, though the circle is, in
fact a result of his own Ideas. A person who has in his mind the
measures of different lines and countries on the earth's surface, and
who can put them together into one conception, finds that they can
make no figure but a globular one: to him, the earth's globular form
is a Fact, as much as the square form of his chamber. A person to
whom the grounds of believing the earth to travel round the sun are
as familiar as the grounds for believing the movements of the mail
coaches in this country, looks upon the former event as a Fact, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
as he looks upon the latter events as Facts. And a person who,
knowing the Fact of the earth's annual motion, refers it distinctly to
its mechanical cause, conceives the sun's attraction as a Fact, just as
he conceives as a Fact, the action of the wind which turns the sails of
a mill. He cannot <em>see</em> the force in either case; he supplies it out of
his own Ideas. And thus, a true Theory is a Fact; a Fact is a
familiar Theory. That which is a Fact under one aspect, is a Theory
under another. The most recondite Theories when firmly established
are Facts; the simplest Facts involve something of the nature of
Theory. Theory and Fact correspond, in a certain degree, with
Ideas and Sensations, as to the nature of their opposition. But the
Facts are Facts, so far as the Ideas have been combined with the
Sensations and absorbed in them: the Theories are Theories, so far
as the Ideas are kept distinct from the Sensations, and so far as it is
considered still a question whether those can be made to agree with
these.</p>

<p>"We may, as I have said, illustrate this matter by considering man
as <em>interpreting</em> the phenomena which he sees. He often interprets
without being aware that he does so. Thus when we see the needle
move towards the magnet, we assert that the magnet exercises an
attractive force on the needle. But it is only by an interpretative act
of our own minds that we ascribe this motion to attraction. That,
in this case, a force is exerted&mdash;something of the nature of the pull
which we could apply by our own volition&mdash;is our interpretation
of the phenomena; although we may be conscious of the act of
interpretation, and may then regard the attraction as a Fact.</p>

<p>"Nor is it in such cases only that we interpret phenomena in our
own way, without being conscious of what we do. We see a tree at
a distance, and judge it to be a chestnut or a lime; yet this is only
an inference from the colour or form of the mass according to preconceived
classifications of our own. Our lives are full of such
unconscious interpretations. The farmer recognizes a good or a bad
soil; the artist a picture of a favourite master; the geologist a rock
of a known locality, as we recognize the faces and voices of our
friends; that is, by judgments formed on what we see and hear; but
judgments in which we do not analyze the steps, or distinguish the
inference from the appearance. And in these mixtures of observation
and inference, we speak of the judgment thus formed, as a Fact
directly observed.</p>

<p>"Even in the case in which our perceptions appear to be most
direct, and least to involve any interpretations of our own,&mdash;in the
simple process of seeing,&mdash;who does not know how much we, by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
act of the mind, add to that which our senses receive? Does any one
fancy that he sees a solid cube? It is easy to show that the solidity
of the figure, the relative position of its faces and edges to each other,
are inferences of the spectator; no more conveyed to his conviction
by the eye alone, than they would be if he were looking at a painted
representation of a cube. The scene of nature is a picture without
depth of substance, no less than the scene of art; and in the one case
as in the other, it is the mind which, by an act of its own, discovers
that colour and shape denote distance and solidity. Most men are
unconscious of this perpetual habit of reading the language of the
external world, and translating as they read. The draughtsman,
indeed, is compelled, for his purposes, to return back in thought from
the solid bodies which he has inferred, to the shapes of surface which
he really sees. He knows that there is a mask of theory over the
whole face of nature, if it be <em>theory</em> to infer more than we <em>see</em>. But
other men, unaware of this masquerade, hold it to be a fact that they
see cubes and spheres, spacious apartments and winding avenues.
And these things are facts to them, because they are unconscious of
the mental operation by which they have penetrated nature's disguise.</p>

<p>"And thus, we still have an intelligible distinction of Fact and
Theory, if we consider Theory as a conscious, and Fact as an unconscious
inference, from the phenomena which are presented to our
senses."&mdash;Whewell, <cite>Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</cite>, B. I. Chap.
ii. Sect. 10.</p>


<h4><a id="F.3"></a>F.&mdash;ON THE "UNKNOWABLE."</h4>

<p>If the word which heads this note could be accepted in the sense
understood by Mr. Spencer's American critic, as a truthful and in
all respects complete description of the First Ground of all things,
there must of course be an end of all Theology, natural, and supernatural;
Theism, Pantheism, and Atheism, would together become
what Comte thought them,&mdash;equally unfounded, equally unmeaning,
and therefore equally to be opposed, condemned, and ostracized.
Between Humanity and all that is Superhuman the gulf would appear
hopelessly impassable.</p>

<p>"To be consistent," says the Editor of the American <cite>Index</cite>, "Empiricism
must utterly sink the soul in its material surroundings...."
Mr. Spencer makes his election in Empiricism, but shrinks from the
acceptance of its necessary implications, and thereby forfeits his title
to rank among the great leaders of philosophy. Teaching that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
faculty of the mind is the effect of impressions made by the Environment
upon the Organism, he should also teach that the mind is nothing
distinct from the organism, and that the mind's faculties will perish at
the disintegration of the organism; that, as fire is a mere phenomenon
of chemical combination, ceasing with it, so life is a mere phenomenon
of organic "re-arrangement of parts," and will cease when the
Dissolution which is the converse and sequel of Evolution has become
complete; and that the "theory of a 'soul' is as completely exploded
as the theory of 'phlogiston.'"</p>

<p>Such is the opinion of an unsympathising reviewer, who calls himself
a Positivist of the latest development. He despises Comte, praises
Hamilton, and preaches the truth of Dualism. "If," he writes,
"physical science sneeringly objects that mental science proceeds
on a sheer assumption of mind, the retort is crushing and cogent
that physical science proceeds on the sheer assumption of matter.
Who ever yet demonstrated the existence of either?... Only
by admitting what can neither be demonstrated without a begging
of the question, nor doubted without a <i lang="la">reductio ad absurdam</i> of all
intelligence,&mdash;namely, the natural veracity of the intuitive and
cognitive powers,&mdash;is a truly positive science possible." From this
dualistic Positivism he predicts the rise of a new Theology. "We
believe that Theism must be re-theologized on the basis of pure
Positivism, as the absolute condition of its future growth." From
the same point of view, Mr. Spencer's "reconciliation of Science
and Religion" is "pretended"; and his "philosophy is chiefly
valuable as indicating the rapid spread of the true spirit of Positivism,"
but, "like Comtism, it possesses little or no value as an
exposition of Positivism in the highest departments of science."</p>

<p>This censure of Spencer was combated in a subsequent number of
the <cite>Index</cite>, by a writer signing himself "Evolutionist." The Editor
prints his letter, and replies to it briefly:&mdash;"1. The 'unknowable'
must be an absolute blank to every intelligence. It surely cannot be
held legitimate to make <em>any predicate</em> of it whatever, as Mr. Spencer
himself admits. Yet he does make predicates of it which are 'derived
from our own natures' and thus violates his own principle. 'Omnipresence'
is simply <em>presence throughout all space</em>; and what do we
know of 'presence' at all but by our own experience? Mr. Spencer
does the very thing he forbids us to do, in making this predication.</p>

<p>"2. The difference between him and us is briefly this. He denies
that we know anything of Force; we affirm that we know it just so
far as it perceptibly acts. The Cause of Nature we maintain to be
known <em>in its effects</em>. Hence Force is not to us the 'Unknowable,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
but is rather the 'God of Science,' known just so far as Nature is
known."</p>

<p>Here follow some stringent criticisms of the distinction between
phenomena and noumena accepted by Mill as well as Spencer, which
we pass over as being somewhat unintelligible without a longer discussion
than can here be given to them.</p>

<p>On the subject of our first quotation&mdash;Empiricism&mdash;many readers
may like to peruse the opinion of a writer far removed from Mr.
Abbott in philosophy. The following is Hegel's dictum:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In Empiricism lies the great principle that whatever is true must
be in the actual world and present to sensation.... Touching this
principle it has been justly observed that, in what we call Experience,
as distinct from the individual sensation of individual facts, there are
two elements. First, there is the infinitely complex matter, which
so far as itself is concerned is individualised: secondly, there is the
form, as seen in the characteristics of universality and necessity.
Empiricism no doubt can point to many, almost innumerable, similar
perceptions: but, after all, no multitude, however great, can be the
same thing as universality. Similarly, Empiricism reaches so far as
the perception of changes in succession and of objects in juxtaposition
or co-existence; but it presents no necessary connexion. If sensation,
therefore, is to maintain its claim to be the sole basis of what men
hold for truth, universality and necessity can have no right to exist:
they become an accident of our minds, a mere custom, the content of
which might be otherwise constituted than it is.</p>

<p>"It is an important corollary of this theory, that in the empirical
mode of treatment the truths and rules of justice and morality, as well
as the body of religion, are exhibited as the work of chance, and
stripped of their objective character and inner truth."<a name="FNanchor_133_161" id="FNanchor_133_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_161" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Considering how far Hegel confirms the American Positivist's
opinion respecting the inevitable conclusions of consistent Empiricism,
Mr. Spencer may with reason be congratulated on his very
happy inconsistency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>The subject of quotation No. 2&mdash;Spencer's position in regard of
the Unknowable&mdash;contains a censure which unites in alliance many
widely differing authorities on this side the Atlantic. Some of these
assail it from an extremely hostile point of view; but the criticism
of others is conceived in a half-friendly, half-indifferent spirit. Mr.
Spencer has very lately published a third volume of "Essays," and
devotes Articles X. and XI. to his reviewers.<a name="FNanchor_134_162" id="FNanchor_134_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_162" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> It need hardly be
said that these pages will repay perusal. We shall here venture on
giving a brief account of his defence as it presents itself to our own
understanding.</p>

<p>The most salient difference between him and his critics <em>generally</em>,
seems to lie in this circumstance;&mdash;they begin by taking the word
"Unknowable" in its strict (<i>i.e.</i> its proper) signification. Hence
they appear to assume that by "Absolute" he means&mdash;or <em>ought</em> to
mean even when seeming to say the contrary&mdash;"<em>absolutely</em> abstract."
Now of a mere, that is, a pure and complete abstraction, nothing can
be predicated, because the idea is perfectly empty. It is in fact a
Nothingness.</p>

<p>But suppose we say of this Absolute, (as Spencer does), it exists;&mdash;we
<em>have</em> predicated something already;&mdash;something which destroys
its complete emptiness. And again, if we are asked or, (what is
better), ask ourselves how we <em>know</em> that an Absolute does exist, and
proceed to reply, as Spencer himself replies, because it <em>must</em> exist;
we shall have made respecting our Absolute this highest of all possible
predications. It is not only Being, but necessary Being, or, in other
words, it is a Self-Existent. Still more, since it is so in contradistinction
from the universe of relativities, it is The Self-Existent, a totally
different idea from that which the American editor dissects.</p>

<p>But now comes the question, who or what is answerable for the
Reviewer's misconception,&mdash;Spencer or his critics? Is it the poverty
of language, or the law of controversial sequency,&mdash;a law under which
every thought arises as antagonistic to some other thought, and afterwards,
when arisen and firmly established so as to become the subject
of analysis, is found to yield more than was at first conceived. Then,
of course, another antithesis arises respecting it, and we have to
decide how much and what is truly meant, a question which often
comes before us in this shape:&mdash;Is our thought merely the <em>not</em> so and
so, or is it a real <em>substantive</em> idea? In the former case it is one-sided
and negative; in the latter it is many-sided and affirmative.</p>

<p>At the first blush, it seems natural to blame Mr. Herbert Spencer.
Every one must feel astonished to find how much he himself knows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the Unknowable. The following sentences, however, contain a good
account of one amongst his principal explanations of this apparent
incongruity. Speaking of Mr. Martineau's conception of the Creator,<a name="FNanchor_135_163" id="FNanchor_135_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_163" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
he writes (<cite>Essays</cite>, Vol. III. p. 299):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Finding, as just shewn, that it leaves the essential mystery unsolved;
I do not see that it has an advantage over the doctrine of the
Unknowable in its unqualified shape. There cannot, I think, be more
than temporary rest in a proximate solution which takes for its basis
the ultimately insoluble. Just as thought cannot be prevented from
passing beyond Appearance, and trying to conceive the Cause behind;
so, following out the interpretation Mr. Martineau offers, thought
cannot be prevented from asking what Cause it is which restricts the
Cause he assigns. And if we must admit that the question under this
eventual form cannot be answered, may we not as well confess that
the question under its immediate form cannot be answered? Is it not
better candidly to acknowledge the incompetence of our intelligence,
rather than to persist in calling that an explanation which does but
disguise the inexplicable? Whatever answer each may give to this
question, he cannot rightly blame those who, finding in themselves an
indestructible consciousness of an ultimate Cause, whence proceed
alike what we call the Material Universe and what we call Mind,
refrain from affirming anything respecting it; because they find it as
inscrutable in nature, as it is inconceivable in extent and duration."</p>

<p>There will be to many people much force in this plea for leaving
inscrutables amidst their primary obscurities. But it is open to a
rejoinder suggested by Mr. Spencer himself,&mdash;you cannot prevent the
Mind from inquiring; and, in point of fact, Spencer in person leads the
way. He places before us the ultimate idea of a self-existent First
Cause. Now surely he might reflect that such an Idea not only
permits but invites analysis;&mdash;it is no empty abstraction, but a substantive
thought and a full one. But he bars analysis to his own
satisfaction, by saying that the Idea is in its own Nature inscrutable.
Respecting this position two questions arise. First, if inscrutable as
to its ultimate nature&mdash;its highest essence, and deepest thought,&mdash;is
it so in its attributes? Next, if Spencer's special walk in philosophy
ends with the bare positing of this Idea, must <em>all</em> Philosophy do the
same? Suppose the Physicist says&mdash;"Here I learn to know the
Fact of a self-existent universal First Cause," may not the investigator
of our Practical human Reason try to discover whether an
Ethical view ought or ought not to be taken of this Self-Existent?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
To answer "No," is either to make physical philosophy the <em>sole</em>
philosophy; or it is to dismember and disjoint the universal Body of
Truth into departmental carcase-fragments;&mdash;a process which never
can begin till all Life has been effectually crushed out of the Whole.<a name="FNanchor_136_164" id="FNanchor_136_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_164" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
For every one who takes wide views of Philosophy;&mdash;for every
inquirer into First Principles;&mdash;above all, if Mr. Spencer will permit
us to say so, for every Encyclopædic writer like himself, a question must
arise the answer to which it is incumbent on all and each to ascertain,
"Can we have any conscious idea whatever of a First Cause without
including that very fact of Personality from which Spencer appears to
shrink?" Nay we may rather put the point thus: "Is not our idea
and definition of <em>Causality</em> derived from Personal existence, and apart
from this source of derivation, does not the derived idea perish?"&mdash;If
so, to speak of a non-personal First Cause both of the outside world
and of mind itself is to use words to which no thinker can consciously
attach any real meaning. There must, says Mr. Spencer, be Power
behind Appearance;&mdash;in other words, Phenomena imply a Cause
behind them,&mdash;but to add that this Power or Cause is conceivably
impersonal, seems nothing better than to imagine (Hibernicè) at the
beginning of the phenomenal chain, a <em>prior</em> phenomenon which in its
own nature and <i lang="la">ex vi verborum</i> cannot account for a Beginning<a name="FNanchor_137_165" id="FNanchor_137_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_165" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> at
all;&mdash;cannot, to use Mr. Spencer's expression, be "ultimate"; and,
in short, requires to be accounted for, itself.</p>

<p>The truth is, that such ideas as First, Ultimate, Power accounting
for appearance, or Cause underlying phenomena, cannot be spoken of
as altogether Unknowable; because they imply and contain within
themselves certain knowable and strongly defined characteristics.
Pressed by his critics, Mr. Spencer becomes painfully aware of this
truth; and is fearful of being driven by logic and philosophical consistency
to plead guilty of believing in a Personal Author of the
Universe, and of making Theism the ultimate word of Science. We
see on pp. 292 and 302 of Vol. III. how he manifests a preference for
the phrase non-relative, <em>vice</em> Absolute; meaning thereby (if he means
anything new) to replace an affirmative idea by a negational abstract,
empty enough to land him at once in American Positivism. For, <em>if</em>
the non-relative means <em>more</em> than to say that he is unable to predicate
<em>relativity</em> of the <em>whole</em> Universe of things&mdash;if it means <em>more</em> than an
avowal of Positivist ignorance&mdash;it really does mean a true Absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
after all; and very few students of Mr. Spencer will doubt that in
the sense of an Absolute (not necessarily Hegelian), this ground idea
of his must be accepted.</p>

<p>As courteous antagonists, we will endeavour to abstain from joining
with Mr. Sidgwick in the severest censure which has yet befallen
Mr. Spencer,&mdash;the imputation of a "mazy inconsistency," a "fundamental
incoherence," and an "inability to harmonize different lines
of thought." We rather wish to congratulate him on presenting such
an appearance before the eye of a critic so accomplished, and so equitable;
it is a sign that we have not as yet heard Mr. Spencer's final
utterance. He is, we are quite sure, divided by a wide tract of
thought from the American Positivists;&mdash;but we are <em>not</em> sure that he
may not ultimately be found amid the ranks of Scientific Theists.
This at the present moment appears the most natural development of
the thoughts maintained in his recently published volume. That the
nature of <span class="smcap">God</span>, considered as the "ultimate cause of what we call the
material universe and what we call mind," is to us at present inscrutable;&mdash;that
clouds and darkness are round about Him;&mdash;that His
ways are not as our ways, nor His thoughts as our thoughts, no meditative
Theist will deny. But, though the Heavens are higher than the
Earth, though beatified spirits worship in humble adoration of the
Incomprehensible, yet the measureless distance does not hinder us
from knowing Him as a Spirit, and therefore as a <span class="smcap">Person</span>; nor yet
from confidently affirming that Righteousness and Judgment are the
habitation of His throne.</p>


<h4><a id="G.3"></a>G.&mdash;MR. J. S. MILL AS AN INDEPENDENT MORALIST.</h4>

<p>Few passages of Mr. Mill's writings are better worth reading than
pages 123, 4, of his "Examination of Sir W. Hamilton's Philosophy."
In these pages the eminent writer asserts his own strong
moral sentiments, and throws to the winds that inconsistent Utilitarianism
with which he had trained his mind to associate them. He
will worship no Unknowable Being whose supreme moral nature
does not affirm our human morality. "Why is this?" an opponent
might fairly ask; "is it not useful so to do? is not such worship
conducive to that noblest final end, the interest of mankind?" By
saying "No" you affirm two things: one, the <em>dissociation</em> of Religion
from Utility; a second, the indivisible <em>association</em> of Religion with
absolute Morality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Some antagonists may consider the first of these two propositions
inadmissible, the second objectionable, or at all events, exceedingly
doubtful. Every one who maintains that Natural Theology has, in
addition to its other elements, a firm and moral ground, will accept
with ready assent the second proposition, and will say that the truth
or falsehood of the first depends on the meaning attached to an
ambiguous word. We are equally sure that "Godliness is profitable
for all things," and that "Honesty is the best policy." But then we
are quite sure also, that the final cause of Godliness is not profit, nor
its essential nature a love of gain; and that policy is not a true
description of honesty, nor the being politic the true and proper aim
of the honest man. And Mr. Mill, when his moral sentiments
asserted themselves, felt these certainties as elements of his inner
life. Rather than worship a Being whose unknown moral attributes
fell beneath, not the dictates of Utility, but the purest instincts of his
own inmost morality, Mr. Mill goes on to declare that he is willing to
suffer the horrors of Eternal death.<a name="FNanchor_138_166" id="FNanchor_138_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_166" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Hell is better than a violation
of his own moral nature. Can this be a declaration deduced from
the supreme law of Interest,&mdash;is it not rather a foundation maxim of
independent morality? Violate such foundation maxims, says the
independent moralist, and you need not even speak of "Going to
hell," hell will come to you. Sooner or later you will find its undying
torments within you.</p>

<p>In an article on the death of Mr. Mill, the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> expresses
its perception of his leading inconsistency as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is impossible to read Mr. Mill's works with any attention, and
in particular to look with intelligence on the later part of his career,
without seeing that by temperament he was essentially religious, but
that as far as positive doctrine went his mind was an absolute blank.
We believe that it was this sharp contrast between theory and feeling
which drove him into the schemes for the improvement of the world
which have been exposed to so many, and, in some respects, to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
well-founded objections. Having to love something, and being, as it
were, chained down by his own logic to this world and this life, past,
present, and future, he struggled to make a sort of religion out of man
as he might come to be after centuries or millenniums. Humanity,
progress, a realization of all the ideals at which his theories pointed&mdash;these
were his divinities, for he was a man who could not do without
some divinity, and he could find no other. We do not think that
his life or his thoughts were triumphant. If he had consistently
followed out his own views, if he had carried out his Benthamism
with perfect consistency, the result would have been too hard, too
grim, too dismal for his eager and sensitive heart. Hence came the
faltering, the inconsistency, the romance of his later days. It is a
spectacle which may well humble every one who looks on it with
intelligence and sympathy. From us, at least, it shall never draw
one word of sarcasm, or one thought which is not full of deep respect,
regret, and pity. He bore a burden common to many. If he bent
under it, it was not because his strength was less, but because his
sensibility was greater. When he died one of the tenderest and most
passionate hearts that ever set to work an intellect of iron was laid to
rest. May he rest in peace, and find, if it be possible, that his knowledge
was less complete than he perhaps supposed, and that there was
more to be known than was acknowledged in his philosophy." (<cite>Pall
Mall Gazette</cite>, Saturday, May, 10, 1873.)</p>

<p>A little earlier in the same article we find another paragraph worthy
of careful consideration:&mdash;"No succession of writers ever exercised
greater power over the fortunes of this nation, we might say of any
nation, than Locke, Hume, Adam Smith, Bentham, and Mr. Mill.
What may be described as the theory of modern life has been thought
out by them, and translated into its practical equivalents with a persistency,
a precision, a degree of method and calmness unequalled in
the history of thought. We do not say that their results are complete,
but we do say that their teaching has been successful to an unexampled
degree; and that, however unpopular it may be with ardent
and enthusiastic persons, it is impossible to believe that it could have
done what it has done without possessing a very strong hold on
human nature."</p>

<p>Viewing this extract by the light of the one before cited, we cannot
help asking what side of human nature is it to which the Benthamite
doctrines attach themselves? Shall we not regret that the hard, the
grim, and the dismal, should characterize our 19th century philosophy?
Philosophy that is falsely so called; for the true is "not harsh and
crabbed as dull fools suppose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>The text of this Essay and its earlier notes were completed while
Mr. Mill was in the ripeness of his powers, and when the present
writer never expected to outlive him. Death softens our view of one
who has passed away&mdash;the bygone life becomes like a moonlighted
landscape&mdash;asperities hidden in shadow, and a soft radiance poured
over each grander eminence. So may it be felt by the critic of every
great departed! If, indeed, it prove otherwise with Mr. Mill, the
preventing cause will probably be found in certain pages of his published
"Autobiography."</p>


<h4><a id="H.3"></a>H.&mdash;ARCHEBIOSIS, OR SPONTANEOUS GENERATION.</h4>

<p>The origin of Life is a question that naturally excites much interest,
and consequently has been much discussed. It is obviously a problem
that presents difficulties of no ordinary kind, and therefore it is by no
means astonishing that many theories have been started and statements
made which have in turn been quickly contradicted.</p>

<p>It is now known that the whole cycle of phenomena&mdash;collectively
denoted by the term "<em>Life</em>,"&mdash;is manifested by a substance possessing
definite physical and chemical properties, and by no other. This
substance constitutes the entire organism of the lower forms of life,
whether animal or vegetable, and also of the higher in their earliest
stage, while from it by various metamorphoses are developed the
different histological elements composing the complex tissues of higher
animals and plants. Its name Protoplasm is in consequence exceedingly
apt, when properly understood.</p>

<p>As to the origin of Protoplasm (or apparent Life) it is clear from a
little consideration that two questions may be asked: first, how did
Protoplasm arise? and secondly, when once this substance had come
into being are we to suppose that from that time to this all Protoplasm
has been derived by unbroken descent from the first Protoplasm, or does
fresh Protoplasm even now arise in the same way as did the first?&mdash;in
other words, does the transition from the inorganic to the organic,
from what has never lived to what is living, still take place as it must
have taken place at some period or another?</p>

<p>To neither of these questions can Physical Science return a perfectly
certain and definite answer. And it must be confessed that as far as
our knowledge of Nature goes, those have the best of it who maintain
first, that all existing Protoplasm implies pre-existing Protoplasm;
secondly, that as to the method, the conditions of the real origin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Protoplasm nothing whatsoever is known; and thirdly, that, notwithstanding
all assertions and experiments to the contrary, the origin of
living things from dead and decaying organic matter (<i>i.e.</i>, matter that
has lived), or from inorganic matter under given conditions (spontaneous
generation, generatio æquivoca, archebiosis) has never been
proved and demonstrated in such a manner as to allow us no room for
hesitation, no place for doubt.</p>

<p>The difficulties and dangers besetting this thorny and much-vexed
subject will be better understood if we institute a short examination
into the history and present condition of the doctrine of Spontaneous
Generation.</p>

<p>It is certain from the results of astronomical and geological investigation,
that at an exceedingly remote epoch, estimated by untold
millions of years, the earth's surface was absolutely unfitted for the
presence of life; nay, more, that even the laws of chemical combination
were suspended, and in abeyance. After the glowing
spheroid cooled down, and various chemical compounds were formed,
life as a matter of fact made its appearance on the earth. Throughout
the inorganic world the continuity is unbroken&mdash;the present is truly
the child of the past. But in the organic world it is not so. Whether
life arose in the natural course of universal law, or how it did arise,
we cannot tell, scientifically, that is to say; no assertion, one way or
the other, admits either of proof or disproof. There are absolutely
no data to proceed upon. The very first organic remains discovered
belong to a comparatively high type. It is as though in a garden
every plant and bush burst at once into full flower, and never showed
the flower in the bud.</p>

<p>These points are very well put in a passage of Littré:<a name="FNanchor_139_167" id="FNanchor_139_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_167" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> "Jusqu'à
ce moment, nous avons cheminé de phénomènes en phénomènes qui
se passaient tous sous le régime des lois chimiques et physiques. Leur
succession ne présentait aucune solution de continuité; les degrés
tenaient l'un à l'autre; et c'est cette déduction qui satisfait l'esprit
humain, et qu'il nomme explication. Une fois que l'on reconnait
une dissémination première, dans l'espace, d'une matière douée de
gravitation et de mouvement, tout en ignorant absolument d'où vient
cette matière and d'où procèdent son mouvement et sa dissémination,
le reste s'ensuit. Des amas qu'on appelle soleils se forment par
condensation; cette condensation développe une immense chaleur;
le refroidissement graduel sépare les amas primordiaux en amas
secondaires et plus petits qui se meuvent comme lui, se refroidissent
comme lui, et représentent nos planètes, nos satellites, et en particulier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
notre terre. On a l'univers, on passe au monde, et du monde au
globe terrestre.</p>

<p>"Mais là, sur le monde terrestre, un hiatus se présente. Un phénomène
nouveau, une force nouvelle apparaît, et la vie se développe en
végétalité et animalité. Ce phénomène nouveau, cette force nouvelle,
cette vie ne succèdent point par une action continue aux actions continues
dont le soleil et la terre sont le théâtre; du moins, en l'état
actuel de nos connaissances, la continuité nous échappe. On conçoit,
grâce à des faits expérimentaux recueillis de toutes parts et transformés
en lois, comment notre globe se refroidit, comment, en se
refroidissant, il prend sa forme, comment l'atmosphère, les continents,
la mer se constituent; mais on ne conçoit plus comment la vie y
parait à un moment donné. Et ce fut bien à un moment donné:
pendant des millions de siècles, la terre, vu son incandescence, fut
impropre à toute vie. Quand la température y eut baissé au degré
compatible avec les existences vivantes, ces existences se montrèrent;
mais comment? par quel procédé?</p>

<p>"Il ne faut pourtant pas faire valoir outre mesure cette discontinuité.
Une discontinuité, autre que celle qui appartient à l'apparition de la
vie, est survenue dans le cours du développement de la terre. Quand
les particules qui la composent, étaient animées d'une immense
chaleur, une dissociation complète y régnait; elles n'obéissaient
qu'aux lois du mouvement, de la gravitation, de la chaleur et de la
lumière; les lois chimiques, c'est-à-dire de combinaison et de décombinaison,
n'y étaient qu'à l'état virtuel. Elles passèrent à l'état
effectif, dès que l'abaissement de la température le permit. Je sais
bien qu'une différence considérable existe entre ces deux discontinuités:
en effet, depuis lors, il a toujours été possible de reproduire
à volonté les faits chimiques; et, toutes les fois que nous en avons
besoin, nous répétons le phénomène d'origine qui se produisit dans
les combinaisons et décombinaisons. Pour la vie, c'est autre chose;
elle a été une fois émise, et, depuis le phénomène d'origine, elle ne se
propage que par génération. Un être vivant est necessaire pour produire
un être vivant; et, ni par les procédés de la nature, ni par ceux
de la science, ce qui se fit au moment créateur ne se refait. Malgré
cette considérable différence, il demeure que la terre a possédé des
forces virtuelles qui sont entrées en action, quand les conditions
générales, se modifiant graduellement, l'ont permis."</p>

<p>A little further on he continues:&mdash;"Au point de vue d'origine, on
abandonnera la question comme toutes les questions qui impliquent une
cause première. La philosophie positive s'exprime là-dessus comme
elle s'exprime touchant toutes les choses hyperphysiques, c'est-à-dire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
placées au delà de l'expérience. Quand elle entend les matérialistes
prononcer que la vie est le résultat des forces physiques et chimiques
dont on connaît l'action, elle refuse d'accepter une solution qui
dépasse les prémisses. Mais elle n'écarte pas la solution matérialiste
au profit de la solution théologique; l'intervention d'un Dieu
créateur est également invérifiable par l'expérience, et, partant, atteinte
de la même fin de non-recevoir. Maintenant, si on demande à la
philosophie positive quelle est, à elle, sa solution entre la génération
matérialiste et la création surnaturelle, elle répond qu'elle n'a aucune
solution à proposer, que rien ne peut la forcer à croire ce qui n'est
pas démontré, et qu'elle accepte, avec autant de fermeté que d'humilité,
une ignorance invincible sur tout ce qui est indemontrable."</p>

<p>In the first passage certain salient points are strikingly brought
out, above all the vast difference between the worlds organic and
inorganic; but, next, how much soever a Positivist may be pleased to
believe only that which admits of phenomenal verification, it is not
every one, especially if given to thought, who would willingly endorse
the second paragraph. If we know only what we can verify, many
beliefs must needs be abandoned, and amongst them some which
have received the almost universal assent of mankind. Knowledge
(in the sense of verifiable knowledge) and Belief may appear two
widely different things; but it should never be forgotten that we often
accept the one as surely as the other.</p>

<p>The ancients held that living things arose from the earth at any
time, engendered by the warmth of the sun and moisture. Absurd
as it may seem, the belief that blue-bottle flies, etc., were a natural
result of the decay of meat and other organic matter obtained credence
even in comparatively modern times. Redi, an eminent Italian,
first demonstrated experimentally the falsehood of this doctrine, and
for some time the hypothesis of spontaneous generation appeared to
have received a death-blow. And by degrees the conviction that
every living thing proceeded from a germ gained strength, and was
confirmed by the rapidly extending use of the microscope. Yet in
the eighteenth century certain experiments of Needham seemed to
establish the fact that in boiled infusions where presumably all germs
were destroyed, small Infusoria made their appearance even when
means were taken to exclude the entrance of fresh germs. Buffon
lent the authority of his great name. These experiments were
repeated by the Abbé Spallanzani, who showed by more careful
methods the fallacy of the conclusions drawn. A passage in Sir B.
Brodie<a name="FNanchor_140_168" id="FNanchor_140_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_168" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> which alludes to these facts may be worth quoting:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>
<p>"Crites. Then am I to understand that you would reject altogether
the hypothesis of equivocal generation, which supposes that
under certain circumstances, even at the present time, particles of
inorganic matter are brought together, and so united as to become
endowed with organization and life?</p>

<p>"Eubulus. The question is one of great interest, and I will refer
you to Ergates for an answer, knowing at the same time pretty well
what that answer will be.</p>

<p>"Ergates. Of course Crites refers to the production of those
minute creatures, known by the name of <i>Infusoria</i>, in the experiments
of Walter Needham, and some others.</p>

<p>"It is true that in these experiments certain vegetable and animal
infusions, after no very long period of time, when examined by the
microscope, are found to contain a multitude of minute creatures, of
various forms, exhibiting signs of spontaneous motion, and multiplying
their species in the usual manner. Some of these are even of a
complicated structure, much beyond what might, <i lang="la">à priori</i>, be expected
as the result of the first attempt of inorganic matter to enter into the
realms of organic life. The subject has been so frequently discussed,
that I need not trouble you with the details of the arguments which
have led the most eminent naturalists to believe that these creatures
are not really spontaneously engendered, but that they are derived
from minute ova which are present in the air, and which, when placed
under circumstances favourable to their development, burst into life:
in the same way as the egg undergoes those changes which convert
its contents into a bird, when placed under the influence of the animal
heat of the parent. But even if this view of the matter be not
correct, the case is not really altered; for, after all, the <i>Infusoria</i> are
never detected except in vegetable and animal infusions, which necessarily
presuppose the existence of organic life."</p>

<p>But it is one thing to demolish the theory and statements of an
antagonist, and another to erect a structure in their place. However
completely Spallanzani had demonstrated the faults and untrustworthiness
of Needham's results, he had not established the opposite
doctrine, and to many it seemed that the very conditions under which
his experimentation was conducted, were sufficient to prevent the
development of life. But the work begun by Schulze and Schwann
and ended by Pasteur apparently has supplied what was wanting in
Spallanzani's researches. The evidence is thus admirably summed by
Professor Huxley:<a name="FNanchor_141_169" id="FNanchor_141_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_169" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is demonstrable, that a fluid eminently fit for the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of the lowest forms of life, but which contains neither germs, nor
any protein compound, gives rise to living things in great abundance,
if it is exposed to ordinary air; while no such development takes
place, if the air with which it is in contact is mechanically freed from
the solid particles, which ordinarily float in it and which maybe made
visible by appropriate means.</p>

<p>"It is demonstrable, that the great majority of these particles are
destructible by heat, and that some of them are germs, or living
particles, capable of giving rise to the same forms of life as those
which appear when the fluid is exposed to unpurified air.</p>

<p>"It is demonstrable, that inoculation of the experimental fluid with
a drop of liquid known to contain living particles, gives rise to the
same phenomena as exposure to unpurified air.</p>

<p>"And it is further certain that these living particles are so minute
that the assumption of their suspension in ordinary air presents not
the slightest difficulty. On the contrary, considering their lightness
and the wide diffusion of the organisms which produce them, it is
impossible to conceive that they should not be suspended in the
atmosphere in myriads."</p>

<p>The experimental means by which these facts are proved may be
briefly stated:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The air contains solid particles. Professor Tyndall has shown,
as all who have read "Dust and Disease" know to their own discomfort,
that the purest common air, when submitted to a beam of
electric light, renders the track of that beam visible. Ergo, it must
contain solid particles capable of scattering light.</p>

<p>II. These particles are mostly destructible by heat, or may be
mechanically strained off. He has shown this by the fact that
common air which has passed through a red-hot tube, or through a
filter of cotton-wool, will no longer render the track of the electric
beam visible.</p>

<p>III. Many of these particles are germs. Schulze and Schwann
proved that when air is passed through red-hot tubes, then through a
fluid which is capable of affording a nidus to the germs, if present, no
development of life takes place. Similarly Schr&oelig;der established the
same fact by using a strainer of cotton-wool. Further, Pasteur gave
an additional proof by microscopical examination, as well as by a
direct experiment. He passed air through gun-cotton, dissolved this
in ether; and in the collodion germs were clearly recognizable. Also
he plunged a piece of cotton-wool through which air had been strained
into an experimental fluid. This fluid soon swarmed with forms of
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>IV. The experimental fluid may be inoculated by simple exposure
to air as well as by any fluids known to contain living forms; <i>e.g.</i>, if
the fluid be placed in an open vessel, living forms soon make their
appearance. Yet supposing the aperture of the vessel, instead of
pointing vertically upwards, be turned obliquely or downwards, the
fluid will remain clear for an indefinite time. Similarly a drop of an
infusion containing living forms added to the experimental fluid soon
causes it to swarm with life. The forms that appear are the same in
either case.</p>

<p>V. The experimental fluid cannot give rise itself to these forms.
It is known as Pasteur's solution, and consists of water, ammonium,
tartrate, sugar, and yeast ash. Hence there is no organic matter in
it. If proper care be taken, it may be kept for an indefinite time.</p>

<p>VI. The germs are so minute that in many cases, even when known
to be present, they are scarcely visible to the highest microscopic
powers. They must be universally diffused, as any organic infusion
left exposed soon swarms with the forms to which they give rise.</p>

<p>Such an array of facts, proved experimentally over and over again,
must convince the most tenacious sceptic, and he may feel inclined to
agree with the opinion expressed in the following passage from Sir B.
Brodie:<a name="FNanchor_142_170" id="FNanchor_142_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_170" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Crites. Then, if I understand you rightly, you have arrived
at these conclusions. First, that there was a time when this earth
was not in a fit state for the maintenance of either animal or
vegetable life. Secondly, that in its present condition there is no
evidence of any law being in operation which would account for any
living beings being called into existence except as the offspring of
other living beings which previously existed; and that from these
premises we cannot fail to arrive at this further conclusion, that the
first introduction of life on earth must have been by some special act
of the creative power, of which we have no experience at present.</p>

<p>"Eubulus. I suspect that this, really and truly, is all we actually
know on the subject."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this apparently irresistible amount of evidence,
the question of abiogenesis has recently been revived by Dr. C.
Bastian in a well-known book, "The Beginnings of Life." Dr.
Bastian believes that he has demonstrated the origin of living organisms
from organic infusions as well as from solutions of salts containing
no organic matter: nay, even more wonderful facts than these
which it is unnecessary to specify. His experiments are so numerous,
his assertions and figures so clear and definite, and his reputation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
previous good scientific work once so high, that the book has caused
no small stir and discussion. Could Dr. Bastian's facts be only
established, they would inevitably revolutionize the whole science of
Biology.</p>

<p>However, the same fate which has overtaken his predecessors has
befallen Dr. Bastian himself. A nearly universal verdict of "Not
proven" has been returned: and not only is the accuracy of his
experimentation denied, but even worse accusations have been
brought. To enter into details of his experiments would require too
much space, but it may not be uninteresting to detail some of the
peculiarities and difficulties which attend on the investigation of such
a subject as Spontaneous Generation.</p>

<p>At the very threshold of the inquiry stands a grand difficulty.
Strange as it may seem, it is nevertheless true, that notwithstanding
the many years, the immense labour bestowed by illustrious men on
this subject, next to nothing is known of the relations existing
between the lowest forms of life, animal or vegetable (especially the
latter), as well as their germs, and varying physical and chemical
conditions. Heat, light, cold and darkness, alkalies and acids with
other chemical compounds, one would imagine to be not without their
influence. Yet what this influence may be in a given case, none can
tell. Enough is known in the way of a few detached facts to make
it certain that these agents have very decided effects. It might be
thought that any one who wished to attack the problem of Spontaneous
Generation anew would first try to obtain some connected knowledge
on this point. Indeed, until it has been cleared up somewhat, it is
not very evident what good Experimentation on Heterogenesis can do.
It is much as if a chemist were to throw a handful of stuff (what he
knew not) into a crucible, and then expect a valuable result. It can
scarcely be doubted that many of these lower organisms live and
grow under conditions which <i lang="la">à priori</i> might seem incompatible with
vitality.</p>

<p>It is clear also that the work of one experimenter ought to be
such as may admit of repetition by another with the same result.
Now no one who attempts the study of this subject of Spontaneous
Generation, can fail to be struck with the immense mass of conflicting
evidence. Some mischievous spirit appears to have purposely
thrown confusion over the whole. Facts are alternately stated and
denied. It is very hard to be sure of the right road, even for an
experienced person.</p>

<p>Another point relates to the value of the evidence when obtained.
It can scarcely be doubted that out of a given number of experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
undertaken to establish a case of Heterogenesis or Archebiosis, great
value should be attached to the negative evidence afforded by those
that disprove the supposed fact. A little consideration will show the
reason. The precautions to be taken against the intrusion of germs are
innumerable: a slight exposure to the air, accidental contact of an
unheated rod or tube, or neglect of some other particulars may
inoculate the experimental fluid. Hence even with care the chances
are many in favour of some such accidental intrusion, and great
caution should always be exercised before an affirmative result can
be regarded as firmly established.</p>

<p>And further there is the experimentalist himself to be taken into
account. The task requires an intimate knowledge of many minute
organisms, and the different forms they assume; an acquaintance,
wide and accurate, with various experimental methods; a clear view
of the end and the various precautions required to attain that end; a
mind ready to contrive, prone to doubt and to hesitate, rather than to
be convinced. Men vary much in the amount of what is scientifically
termed their personal equation, and one difficulty in accepting the
results of a piece of work is the danger of misplaced confidence.</p>

<p>As was said before, Dr. Bastian's attempt to demonstrate the reality
of Spontaneous Generation has been a failure. His experiments have
been repeated, and failed to give the like results in the hands of
competent men. Witness the following quotation from a careful review
of his book in the Microscopical Journal.<a name="FNanchor_143_171" id="FNanchor_143_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_171" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> It relates to the now
celebrated cheese and turnip solution.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless in consequence of the interest which Dr. Bastian's
work has excited, we have made the experiment (and that repeatedly)
as directed by him. This is not the occasion on which to give the
details of the experiments in question. It will, however, perhaps add
some value to the remarks which it has been our duty to make when
we state that, carefully following Dr. Bastian's directions, using at the
same time great care as to cleanliness and due boiling, we have obtained
results which <em>in every single instance</em>, out of more than forty tubes
closed on four separate occasions, simply contradict Dr. Bastian. We
believe, then, that Dr. Bastian's last dogma in archebiosis,&mdash;his belief
in turnip solution with a fragment of cheese&mdash;must be placed in the
same category as his colloidal urea, his spontaneously generated
bog-moss, his fungi born in crystals, his unmistakable processes of
heterogenesis, and his 'watching' and 'experimentation' in general."</p>

<p>The reviewer proceeds to question whether Dr. Bastian has even the
knowledge requisite for so delicate an investigation. It would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
supposed that he was intimately acquainted with various microscopical
structures; but we read,<a name="FNanchor_144_172" id="FNanchor_144_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_172" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> "Professor Huxley gives a contribution
towards the determination of the personal value in Dr. Bastian's
researches. 'He (Dr. Bastian) will recollect that he wrote to me
asking permission to bring for my examination certain preparations
of organic structures, which he declared he had clear and positive
evidence to prove to have been developed in his closed and digested
tubes. Dr. Bastian will remember that when the first of these wonderful
specimens was put under my microscope I told him at once that it was
nothing but a fragment of the leaf of the common bog-moss (Sphagnum),
and he will recollect that I had to fetch Schacht's book "Die Pflanzenzelle"
and show him a figure which fitted very well with what we
had under the microscope before I could get him to listen to my
suggestion, and that only actual comparison with Sphagnum, after he
had left my house, forced him to admit the astounding blunder which
he had made.'</p>

<p>"Of these three pieces of evidence, the last is the most important,
for, whilst it places us on our guard with regard to Dr. Bastian's
accuracy generally, it at the same time furnishes a key to the explanation
of a number of his experiments in which, according to that precipitate
discoverer, 'organisms' were found on opening tubes containing
infusions which had been boiled and sealed hermetically."</p>

<p>How then are we to sum up the case? for or against Dr. Bastian?
Can any thoughtful person admit the conclusions of one apparently so
unfit for his task? The best answer is in the words of his Reviewer.<a name="FNanchor_145_173" id="FNanchor_145_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_173" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>"Briefly it is to be said that the chapters in this book on heterogenesis,
contain a reckless attempt to revolutionize biological doctrine
without a single demonstration of fact to justify it, even if it be admitted
that the observations and drawings cited are accurate. Revolution
in science as in politics can only be justified by success&mdash;a wanton
attempt in either sphere must deserve the severest condemnation. Dr.
Bastian by his exhibition of himself in dealing with heterogenesis
writes himself down as incapable&mdash;as inadmissible in the character of
a witness in a scientific investigation. The Sphagnum delusion is
now explained, for it becomes evident that we have to deal with an
individual with whom such delusions are no rare exceptions.</p>

<p>"We should indeed be sorry to believe that Dr. Bastian is himself
aware of the injury which he is doing to the cause of science, by
promulgating these rash assertions as to the beginnings and changes
of living things; we altogether decline to entertain the notion that he
is himself conscious of the baselessness and flimsy character of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
startling discoveries, and is nevertheless willing at the expense of
injury to the cause of intellectual progress, to obtain for himself a
temporary notoriety. On the contrary, we believe that he is under the
influence of a delusion, similar to those which from time to time obtain
notoriety in the case of 'spiritualists,' 'circle-squarers,' and such victims
of belief in the marvellous. The origin and mode of growth of such
delusions form a very interesting psychological study, and it is only
when we have obtained a proper conception of Dr. Bastian as an
abnormal psychological phenomenon that we can hope rightly to
appreciate the whole of the statements made in his book.</p>

<p>"Delusion and self-deception are much commoner than the world
is generally accustomed to consider them. In a very well-known and
often quoted remark we have a recognition of the wide-spread occurrence
of delusions and an attempt to explain their origin; the saying to which
we allude is, 'The wish was father to the thought.' There cannot be
the least doubt that men are unconsciously hindered or misdirected in
their estimate of fact by previously formed desires. Such a desire acts
on the mind like the suggestion of the mesmerist to an individual who
has allowed himself to be brought into the hypnotic condition. In this
way many misconceptions and strange contradictions of testimony are
to be explained."</p>

<p>The importance of the subject is sufficient apology for so long a
quotation. But our quotations allow us to draw one conclusion; that
so far as Spontaneous Generation is concerned human knowledge is
exactly <i lang="la">in statu quo</i>. Up to this time there is no evidence, worth
consideration, that establishes a single good case of heterogenesis;
nay, rather all evidence points to the conclusion that Protoplasm is
invariably derived from pre-existing Protoplasm, at least under existing
conditions. Then too there is no fact known which enables us to say
how Protoplasm arose in the first instance. On this point we are in
the darkness of complete scientific ignorance. The whole discussion
may be well closed by a striking passage from Professor Huxley's
before quoted address.<a name="FNanchor_146_174" id="FNanchor_146_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_174" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>"But though I cannot express this conviction of mine too strongly,
I must carefully guard myself against the supposition that I intend to
suggest that no such thing as abiogenesis ever has taken place in the
past, or ever will take place in the future. With organic chemistry,
molecular physics, and physiology yet in their infancy, and every
day making prodigious strides, I think it would be the height of presumption
for any man to say that the conditions under which matter
assumes the properties we call 'vital' may not, some day, be artificially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
brought together. All I feel justified in affirming is, that I see no
reason for believing that the feat has been performed yet.</p>

<p>"And, looking back through the prodigious vista of the past, I find
no record of the commencement of life, and therefore I am devoid of
any means of forming a definite conclusion as to the conditions of its
appearance. Belief, in the scientific sense of the word, is a serious
matter, and needs strong foundations. To say, therefore, in the
admitted absence of evidence, that I have any belief as to the mode
in which the existing forms of life have originated, would be using
words in a wrong sense. But expectation is permissible where belief
is not; and if it were given me to look beyond the abyss of geologically
recorded time to the still more remote period when the earth was passing
through physical and chemical conditions, which it can no more see
again than a man can recal his infancy, I should expect to be a witness
of the evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter. I should
expect to see it appear under forms of great simplicity, endowed, like
existing Fungi, with the power of determining the formation of new
protoplasm from such matters as ammonium carbonates, oxalates and
tartrates, alkaline and earthy phosphates, and water, without the aid
of light. That is the expectation to which analogical reasoning leads
me; but I beg you once more to recollect that I have no right to call
my opinion anything but an act of philosophical faith."</p>

<p>Obviously, as Professor Huxley points out, between philosophical
faith and philosophical knowledge there is a chasm to be bridged over.
But should the hypothesis ever be verified, it would make no difference
to the reasonings of the Natural Theologian&mdash;since the concurrence of
conditions necessary for the production of the phænomenon would
manifestly ensue upon some definite though recondite law, at present
beyond our ken.</p>


<h4><a id="I.3"></a>I.&mdash;ON MATERIALISM.</h4>

<p>The ambiguities attaching to this term were mentioned in a foot-note
on our very first page. Since that note was written, the tendency
of scientific men has been to increase the number of hypotheses
respecting the nature and laws of the material world, and by consequence
to multiply the shades of signification conveyed by the
word Materialism.</p>

<p>So long as such distinctions are confined to the territory of pure
science, whether that of the Physicist or of the Biologist, they do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
in themselves affect the religious (or ethico-religious) position of any
thinker; and need not, therefore, occasion any trouble to the Natural
Theologian. But it is worth while to observe how rashly, on account
of some such scientific discussion, a writer is said to be a Materialist
or no Materialist, by persons who (understanding little or nothing of
science themselves) drag the unhappy author outside the pale of his
own domain, and affix to him some religious or irreligious epithet
which he has neither desired nor deserved.</p>

<p>The philosophic idealist often escapes; he is pronounced "no
Materialist," because he doubts the substantive existence of Matter,
yet he may and often does hold that the ideal thing he calls his soul,
has a life inextricably bound up with that other ideal thing he calls
his body, and must perish with it, never to live again.</p>

<p>We may add the useful remark that so far as Ethico-religious
Materialism is concerned it is much more easily tested by the Doctrine of
Soul than the Doctrine of Body. For example, consistent Materializers
will always maintain that the reasoning human soul differs from the
animal soul of brutes, not in quality, but in quantity. Dr. L. Büchner
(sometimes called a "crass Materialist") makes this assertion repeatedly,
and explains it by adding&mdash;"Man has no absolute advantage
above the animal; his mental superiority being merely relative. There
is not one intellectual faculty which belongs to man <em>exclusively</em>; his
superiority is merely the result of the greater intensity, and the
proper combination, of his capacities. The enlarged human faculties
are, as we have already seen, the natural and necessary result of the
higher and more perfect development of his material organ of
thought."<a name="FNanchor_147_175" id="FNanchor_147_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_175" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<p>Turning to a more refined species of Materialism, we find a similar
value always placed on the dogma that whatever differences exist
between man and brute, they amount to a distinction not of kind, but
only of degree. The consequences hence deduced are of the very greatest
importance, and they run much as follows. No one will venture
to assert that the power of what has been hastily called Volition is,
or can be, an endowment of mere animal nature. We do not lay
upon the tiger (as we do popularly lay upon the tyrant) a moral
responsibility on account of his savage appetites. Their indulgence
does not flow from any reasoning faculty of Will. His cruelty is the
movement of automatic instincts, governed by laws like those which
rule over the inanimate world; more complicated probably, but no-ways
different in their essence. The fall of a stone, and the spring of
a tiger, are both consequences of determining laws inherent in their
several modes of existence, and moving both as machinery is moved
by a steam engine. Now, a difference in degree only, argues no
difference in those essential laws which rule equally the greater and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the less. The giant and the dwarf are alike subject to the same laws
of body and mind; and man is (as we have seen) but a mentally
taller brute. The tyrant, therefore, resembles the tiger; the human
animal is moved as the other animals are moved, and, like them, is
subject to the determining law, just as the lifeless world is so subjected.
In plain words, then, this human machine is moved like other machines.
What we call Reason, spontaneity, volition, are, when analysed, no
exceptions to the law-governed mechanism of the world we live in.
Our motives make us, not we our motives. The faculty we exercise
under the name of Choice, is really neither more nor less than a
determined, unalterable, impulsion; the result of a mechanical law.
And this law has formed and now constitutes the Universe.<a name="FNanchor_148_176" id="FNanchor_148_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_176" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>Refined Materialism proceeds to ask in the next place, what more
do we know of Matter than its rigid undeviating reign of Law?&mdash;The
great Globe itself obeys the same Laws as the falling stone: they
pervade and direct the mechanism of the starry heavens. Life does
not exempt either vegetable or animal from the same rule of law. We
have just seen that Mankind is <em>not</em> so made to differ, as to permit a
plea of exemption from the same empire. Ascend from Protoplasm to
the highest human intelligence,&mdash;one heritage devolves through brute
to man. The same mechanical law accounts for the "Psychogeny"
of both. Mechanical Law, in its ramifications, is (as has been said)
all we really know of Matter. It now turns out that all Mind has
been developed by this same ever-ramifying law; may be analyzed
back into its elements; is most truly expressed by its symbols; and
can never be exempted from its determinations. Mind, therefore, and
Matter are resolvable into this sole unity&mdash;the Law of ultimate
mechanical movement and impulsion.</p>

<p>We have called this system a refined Materialism; but another
name for one of its most influential shapes has appeared and made
considerable progress, particularly on the continent of Europe. This
name is Monism; and is intended to declare that every other belief
must be at best a Dualism.<a name="FNanchor_149_177" id="FNanchor_149_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_177" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a><br /><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>
<p>What then is the true human meaning of this Monistic creed?
Our souls (if we have souls), possess the image, not of Absolute
Being and Personality, but of abstract Fate, and rayless, eyeless
Necessity. We live machines; those supposed moralities we commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
miscall our Volitions, spring out from beneath the moving wheels. We
die, as machines go to pieces when the wheels get out of gear; and
no other account need be asked of the broken clock-work. Here lies
a man, close beside him moulders a dog. They are now what they
always were,&mdash;copartners in the same inexorable destiny.</p>

<p>Inexorable:&mdash;yes; for, standing beside these two graves, we see
where our higher Philosophy and our religious hopes alike lie buried.
What is Mechanical Law to us? The antithesis of Providence;
therefore, with the edict which proclaims its sway, all our prayers
are ended. And what is Man, compared with the equal dog who
bears him company? One event befals them both; yet we may
ask whether before or after that one event, Man has or can have any
preeminence above the beast? Let him be spoken of as statesman,
warrior, orator, poet, painter, sculptor, musician; none of these
epithets convey any truth. He may possibly be a speaking, striking,
weaving, drawing, colouring, sound-producing machine. But the
Designer of the Universe and the human artist have disappeared
together. What we took for the author of immortal works, an
original genius, an inspired hero of his kind, "a man and a leader
of men," was a piece of wheel-work driven by unalterable law. There
was the same "must be" to him as to his dog. There never was and
never could have been, nor yet ever will be any <em>essential</em> difference;
two spirits are gone downwards to the earth.</p>

<p>Man has not even the sad preeminence of Sin. Where can he find
or make room for wrong-doing, when impelling Mechanism determines
all? And where Sin is not, Repentance cannot come.</p>

<p>Hope is shut out along with Remorse and its unmeaning pains.
Man has no ladder of ascent left him; and why should he wish to
climb? If there were such a ladder as Jacob dreamed, its base
must rest on lifeless Law, and at its summit there would only be
this same Law, enthroned and Deified.</p>

<p>Thus, when the primæval Nebula arose in Space (how or why it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
arose is not told us), its vapoury Law contained all that is, and all
that can be:&mdash;Plato and Shakespeare, Moses and St. John glimmered
in its tremulous twilight. Worlds inanimate and animate scintillated
from its fires. What we call Heaven and Earth are its dumb children,
its law-determined Evolutions. Thou and I, O reader, have harboured
strange fancies;&mdash;let them go;&mdash;we are but parts of the Whole; and
the Whole is a mechanical Unity. Now that we find ourselves disabused
and illuminated, our great difficulty may perhaps be to fall
down, Strauss-like, and worship this <i>Universum</i>. Can such worship,
or such an object of worship, bless and satisfy our high aspiring
race? Eyes that have watched for Righteousness, hearts that have
yearned after it, let the answer come from you! In this answer
lives or dies the twofold belief of the Natural Theologian, the twofold
hope resulting to Mankind. The belief, that is to say, in a
personal Immortality, the belief in a personal God.</p>

<p>It may now seem plain that the readiest test of moral or religious
Materialism is its doctrine, not of Body but of Soul. There is no
charm in such a word as Matter to differentiate the character of a
philosophy. Looking at the material world, any thinker may be a
Natural Realist or a Pure Idealist; yet being either or neither, he may
materialize, or the reverse, so far as Morals and Religion are concerned.
The simple question ought rather to be; Is man mechanically
governed by the Law which rules the world of Abiology (the lifeless
inorganic world), or is he, can he become, a Law unto himself?<a name="FNanchor_150_178" id="FNanchor_150_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_178" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>
<p>It would be unfair to omit impressing upon the reader's mind that
physical science <i>per se</i> is by no means answerable for ethico-religious
Materialism. As a question of fact, it does not seem established that
students of Nature, whether physicists or biologists, have, as such,
been the chief offenders. On the contrary, for every single instance
of the kind, it seems quite probable that at least <em>two</em> metaphysical
writers might be found guilty. Obviously, some such large proportion
may reasonably be expected, when we consider that Determinism,
(the word Mill and others prefer to Necessity), is a theory involving
a certain kind of metaphysics.</p>

<p>But the really largest crop of materializers arises from a Debateable
Land. There is a hybrid class of "thinkers," concerning whom the
best physical-science authorities allege that "such nebulous rascals
are mere metaphysicians," while metaphysical speculators, pure and
simple, feel quite sure that "though under a cloud, the gentlemen
must be Physicists."<a name="FNanchor_151_179" id="FNanchor_151_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_179" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>So far as Biology<a name="FNanchor_152_180" id="FNanchor_152_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_180" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> is concerned, let the reader compare Mr. Herbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Spencer's latest utterances already referred to, (in <cite>Essays</cite>, Vol. III.
<i>sub. fin.</i>, especially pp. 249-50), with the following passages from
Mr. Huxley. "I suppose if there be an 'iron' law, it is that of gravitation;
and if there be a physical necessity, it is that a stone,
unsupported, must fall to the ground. But what is all we really know
and can know about the latter phenomenon? Simply, that, in all
human experience, stones have fallen to the ground under these
conditions; that we have not the smallest reason for believing that
any stone so circumstanced will not fall to the ground; and that we
have, on the contrary, every reason to believe that it will so fall. It
is very convenient to indicate that all the conditions of belief have
been fulfilled in this case, by calling the statement that unsupported
stones will fall to the ground, 'a law of nature.' But when, as
commonly happens, we change <em>will</em> into <em>must</em>, we introduce an idea
of necessity which most assuredly does not lie in the observed facts,
and has no warranty that I can discover elsewhere. For my part, I
utterly repudiate and anathematize the intruder. Fact I know; and
Law I know; but what is this Necessity, save an empty shadow of
my own mind's throwing? But if it is certain that we can have no
knowledge of the nature of either matter or spirit, and that the notion
of necessity is something illegitimately thrust into the perfectly
legitimate conception of law, the materialistic position that there
is nothing in the world but matter, force, and necessity, is as utterly
devoid of justification as the most baseless of theological dogmas."
("On the Physical Basis of Life," <cite>Lay Sermons</cite>, pp. 157-8.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And again (pp. 159-60):&mdash;</p>

<p>"We live in a world which is full of misery and ignorance, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
plain duty of each and all of us is to try to make the little corner he
can influence somewhat less miserable and somewhat less ignorant
than it was before he entered it. To do this effectually it is necessary
to be fully possessed of only two beliefs: the first, that the order of
nature is ascertainable by our faculties to an extent which is practically
unlimited; the second, that our volition counts for something as a
condition of the course of events.</p>

<p>"Each of these beliefs can be verified experimentally, as often as
we like to try. Each, therefore, stands upon the strongest foundation
upon which any belief can rest, and forms one of our highest truths.
If we find that the ascertainment of the order of nature is facilitated
by using one terminology, or one set of symbols, rather than another,
it is our clear duty to use the former; and no harm can accrue, so
long as we bear in mind, that we are dealing merely with terms and
symbols."</p>

<p>Symbols, are to the true philosopher like old-fashioned copper
"tokens," privately impressed with letters and devices, but lacking
the Royal image and superscription. They are, as Spencer and
Huxley agree, "unknown quantities;"&mdash;relativities not entities.
They are employable enough where they suit,<a name="FNanchor_153_181" id="FNanchor_153_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_181" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> provided Mr. Huxley's
<i>caveat</i> (p. 161) is steadily kept in mind. "The errors of systematic
materialism may paralyze the energies and destroy the beauty of a
life."</p>

<p>The reader may be pleased to put the subject of Materialism before
himself in a compendious shape as follows:&mdash;If the question asked be,
"<em>What</em> is Matter?" the answer appears little likely to be of moment
to morals or Natural Theology, except so far as human ignorance is
made a plea for Scepticism. But, if it is inquired, "whether the
<em>Mechanical</em> Laws of Matter are the laws of Universal Nature, including
human nature? the issue becomes most momentous. The reply made,
answers another question of the deepest interest:&mdash;"Are there any
conditions under which a Science of Natural Theology is possible?"
If Mechanism be the law of the Universe, Natural Theology is plainly
impossible.</p>

<p>"While we indulge to the <em>Sensitive</em> or <em>Plantal</em> Life, our delights are
common to us with the creatures <em>below</em> us: and 'tis likely, they exceed
us as much in them, as in the senses their subjects; and that's a poor
happiness for Man to aim at, in which Beasts are his Superiours. But
those Mercurial spirits which were only lent the Earth to shew Men
their folly in admiring it; possess delights of a nobler make and nature,
which as it were antedate <em>Immortality</em>; and, at an humble distance,
resemble the joyes of the world of <em>Light</em> and <em>Glory</em>. The <em>Sun</em> and <em>Stars</em>,
are not the world's <em>Eyes</em>, but <em>These</em>: the <em>Celestial Argus</em> cannot glory in
such an universal view. These out-travel theirs, and their <em>Monarch's</em>
beams: passing into <em>Vortexes</em> beyond their Light and Influence; and
with an easie twinkle of an Intellectual Eye look into the <em>Centre</em>, which
is obscur'd from the upper Luminaries. This is somewhat like the Image
of <em>Omnipresence</em>. And what the <em>Hermetical Philosophy</em> saith of <em>God</em>, is
in a sense verifiable of the thus <em>ennobled soul</em>, That <em>its Centre is every
where, but its circumference no where</em>....</p>

<p>" ... And yet there's an higher degree, to which <em>Philosophy</em> sublimes
us. For, as it teacheth a generous contempt of what the grovelling desires
of <em>creeping</em> Mortals Idolize and dote on: so it raiseth us to love and
admire an Object, that is as much above terrestrial, as <em>Infinite</em> can make
it. If <em>Plutarch</em> may have credit, the observation of Nature's Harmony
in the <em>Celestial Motions</em> was one of the first inducements to the belief of
<em>a God</em>. And a greater then he affirms, that the visible things of the
Creation declare him, that made them. What knowledge we have of
them, we have in a sense of their Authour. His face cannot be beheld
by Creature-Opticks, without the allay of a reflexion; and Nature is one
of those mirrors, that represents him to us. And now, the more we
know of him the more we love him, the more we are like him, the
more we admire him. 'Tis here that <em>knowledge wonders</em>; and there's
an <em>Admiration</em>, that's not the <em>Daughter</em> of <em>Ignorance</em>. This indeed
stupidly gazeth at the unwonted <em>effect</em>. But the Philosophical passion
truly admires and adores the supreme <em>Efficient</em>....</p>

<p>".... And from this last article, I think I may conclude the charge,
which hot-brained folly layes in against <em>Philosophy</em>; that it leads to
<em>Irreligion</em>, frivolous and vain. I dare say, next after the divine <em>Word</em>, it's
one of the best friends to <em>Piety</em>. Neither is it any more justly accountable
for the impious irregularities of some, that have paid an homage to
its shrine; than Religion itself for the extravagancies both <em>opinionative</em>
and <em>practick</em> of high pretenders to it. It is a vulgar conceit, that <em>Philosophy</em>
holds a confederacy with <em>Atheism</em> itself, but most <em>injurious</em>: for
nothing can better antidote us against it: and they may as well say, that

<p>"The world offers just now the spectacle, humiliating to us in many
ways, of millions of people clinging to their old idolatrous religions, and
refusing to change them even for a higher form; whilst in Christian
Europe thousands of the most cultivated class are beginning to consider
atheism a permissible, or even a desirable thing. The very instincts of
the savage rebuke us. But just when we seem in danger of losing all,
may come the moment of awakening to the dangers of our loss. A
world where thought is a secretion of the brain-gland, where free-will is
the dream of a madman that thinks he is an emperor though naked and
in chains, where God is not, or at least not knowable, such is not the
world as we learnt it, on which great lives have been lived out, great
self-sacrifices dared, great piety and devotion have been bent to soften
the sin, the ignorance, and the misery. It is a world from which the sun
is withdrawn, and with it all light and life. But this is not our world as
it was, not the world of our fathers. To live is to think and to will.
To think is to see the chain of facts in creation, and passing along its
golden links, to find the hand of God at its beginning, as we saw His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
handiwork in its course. And to will is to be able to know good and
evil; and to will aright is to submit the will entirely to a will higher
than ours. So that with God alone can we find true knowledge and true
rest, the vaunted fruits of philosophy."&mdash;<cite>Limits of Philosophical Inquiry</cite>.

In any point of space, in any section of Time, let there be a living Man;

<p class="center">SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTER IV.</p>


<p class="hang">With the last Chapter closes what may be termed the more critical part
of this Essay. The remainder is occupied with a series of affirmative
arguments.</p>

<p class="hang">The preparation for these arguments having been minutely made, explanatory
additions become less necessary.</p>

<p class="hang">The main object of the present chapter is to establish a tenable Theory
respecting those Human Beliefs among which is included our primary
Belief in Theism. Their nature and validity not having as yet been
sufficiently investigated (see footnote (<i>b</i>) p. 256 <i>post</i>), some extent
of discussion attends the inquiry. To many readers the territory
opened out will appear new. It ought however to be traversed by
all careful students of Psychology.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Analysis</i>:&mdash;Tendencies of the Human Mind resulting in certain concrete

Various explanations of its origin examined and rejected;
particularly the hypothesis which resolves it into Laws of Association.

<p class="center"><big>CHAPTER IV</big>.</p>

<p class="center">BELIEFS OF REASON.</p>


<p>In the last section, we have examined a number of intellectual
perplexities, running closely parallel to certain <i lang="la">primâ-facie</i>
objections commonly alleged against Natural Theism. We
have seen that they are, in reality, difficulties arising from the
impotence of the Human Mind, whenever it is directed to the
contemplation of first or supreme, Principles. In all reason
therefore, they cease to be objections. We are, in fact, constantly
finding ourselves obliged to accept as an undeniable
truth, or a real existence, what when placed objectively before
our mental vision, appears inexplicable, self-contradictory, or
absolutely unthinkable.</p>

<p>The power which compels us to many an admission of this
kind is the <em>mind itself</em>, asserting a strength of insight, in-born
and inalienable, notwithstanding the symptoms of weakness,
which (psychologically speaking) may have seemed threatening
to overcloud and disable it.<a name="FNanchor_AC_182" id="FNanchor_AC_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_182" class="fnanchor">[ac]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>
<p>Hence, we are led to suspect that some at least of those
symptomatic weaknesses, are mistakes in diagnosis. This
suspicion will be shared by most persons tolerably acquainted
with the present state of psychology, and particularly with the
manner in which foregone theories are supported by over-refined
analysis. At all events, the reactionary strength of
the mind is best shown in the concrete beliefs resulting from
its own simplest activities.</p>

<p>Our simplest mental activities are naturally our earliest.
Amongst them, none are more distinctly marked than our impulses
to believe and act upon certain definite pre-suppositions.
These differ from the vague and purposeless dreams of childhood,
by gradually becoming clear, practical, and expansive.
One of the most vigorous, permanent, and prevailing, amongst
them all, is our human belief in the existence of supernatural
power. Upon another presupposition (not originally the
clearest), seems to rest, in the first degree, that principle which
gives validity to all the inductive sciences. We will carefully
examine this latter belief, with the object of drawing from the
process certain aids for an examination of the former.<a name="FNanchor_AD_183" id="FNanchor_AD_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_183" class="fnanchor">[ad]</a></p>

<p>Induction is defined as the legitimate inference of the more
general, from the less general;&mdash;the general from the particular;&mdash;and
(with more startling distinctness) of the Unknown from
the Known. It is at once evident that, whatever may be the
logical form into which this mode of inferring is thrown, there
must in the nature of things be some ulterior principle to give
it legitimacy. This principle, when raised to the rank and
dignity of a philosophic postulate, is commonly known as the
Law of Natural Uniformity. A law claiming such extensive
dominion that one cannot help asking in what code, human
or Divine, of reason or of experience, it was originally found
written.</p>

<p>Let us have recourse to the code of reason first. Euclid
gives admirable instances of things true by necessity of reason.
The moment we understand what right lines are, we see at
once and for all time that two straight lines, infinitely prolonged,
can never inclose a space. No one ever did see a
mathematical line of any kind ("length without thickness"),&mdash;no
one ever saw or conceived any real or ideal thing of infinite
extent, neither can we think infinity at all. Yet the terms of
the geometrical proposition carry their own evidence. We
may sum the case, as Euler the mathematician put it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
finished a demonstration upon <em>Arches</em> by saying, "All experience
is contrary to this, but that is no reason for doubting
its truth."</p>

<p>Now, there appears nothing in the least resembling this
case, in the conception of Natural Uniformity. No thinker
can predicate substantial impossibility of the idea that Nature
should ever be otherwise than Uniform.</p>

<p>Suppose, then, we consider the code of Experience. Where
shall we find the experience required? Ours is far short of
universal, either in an absolute or an approximate sense. We
are the children of to-day&mdash;yet the law wanted must be to
all intents universal. It has been answered to this obvious
requirement, that we enjoy the results of an experience constant
and uniform, "coextensive not with the life of the single
individual who employs them, but with the entire history of
the human race."<a name="FNanchor_154_184" id="FNanchor_154_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_184" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> But in what history is any such experience
written? History in its <em>letter</em>, is full of events
which contradict Nature's uniformity, of interruptions,
marvels, miracles. For cattle to speak, is quite a common
occurrence in Livy. An ordinary Roman would have been
perplexed by the absence of signs and wonders; he would
have felt it something to be accounted for. History tells us
on every written page to believe in what seems impossible;
and some writers on historical evidence, claim for it a greater
amount of credibility whenever it testifies to the greater
number of improbable incidents. For, do not writers of
fiction deal in probabilities?<a name="FNanchor_155_185" id="FNanchor_155_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_185" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>Another method of giving force to the principle of natural
Uniformity, is based on our alleged sense of personal subjection
to the chain of events;&mdash;the outer world is said to penetrate
the inner by an impression of its unvarying sequence, its laws
of unbroken continuity. But does the lesson of life really go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
this way? Most men, when meditating over their own lives,
think rather of the causation they have themselves exercised,
or might have exercised, than of any iron links of causality in
nature. So strongly do they feel their causal power, that,
whereas one man boasts of being the architect of his own
fortunes, another blames himself because he has been foolish
enough to let things take their chance. What people chiefly
realize and act upon, is the relation between Man and Nature&mdash;or,
else between Man and Man;&mdash;relations prolific in consequences
which we shall have to consider by-and-bye.</p>

<p>A more summary mode of explaining our human impression
of natural Uniformity, is by resolving it into certain laws of
Association. We see antecedent and consequent every day,
and get to consider them as indissolubly associated. If we
see a present antecedent, we expect a coming consequent. The
event and its futurity, are thus fused in a common solvent.
Yet, one palpable objection lies against this theory, and it
is fatal. Fatal against it, and against all theories which rest
our belief upon experience, or upon any process of reasoning,
inductive or demonstrated. The objection consists in the
plain fact, that this belief resembles animal instinct<a name="FNanchor_156_186" id="FNanchor_156_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_186" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> in <em>one</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
definite particular&mdash;it exists previously to all observation or
exercise of intelligence on the subject.</p>

<p>We see it in all young creatures. The instinct of children
is to act upon a supposition that the thing they have enjoyed
or suffered shall recur regularly and without interruption.
The darling brought down to dessert every day for a week,
feels injured by a breach of the custom, just as the cat or dog
fed from their masters' table expects the same hand to continue
always kind. Child, kitten, and puppy, need no second
scalding to look askance at the tea-kettle. Grown people's
confidence in the stability of Empires often reposes on no
much stronger foundation. Most men rest satisfied with an
indefinite and unreasoning presumption all their lives long.
They desire no further explanation&mdash;a happy circumstance,
perhaps, considering the theories they might have to
investigate.</p>

<p>Mr. James Mill in his "Analysis of the Human Mind" made
great and continual use of the laws of Association. He applied
them (amongst other ways) to our belief in the uniform
futurities of Nature. "There can" he writes "be no idea of
the Future; because strictly speaking the Future is a non-entity&mdash;of
nothing there can be no idea.... Our whole
lives are but a series of changes, that is, of antecedents and
consequents. The conjunction, therefore, is incessant; and, of
course, the union of the ideas perfectly inseparable." (Vol. I.
pp. 362-3.) And again, (p. 367,) "But I am told, that we
have not only the idea of to-morrow, but the belief of to-morrow;
and I am asked what that belief is. I answer, that
you have not only the idea of to-morrow, but have it
<em>inseparably</em>. It will also appear, that wherever the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
belief is applied, there is a case of the indissoluble association
of ideas. It will further appear, that, in instances without
number, the name belief is applied to a mere case of indissoluble
association; and no instance can be adduced in which anything
besides an indissoluble association can be shewn in
belief. It would seem to follow from this, with abundant
evidence, that the whole of my notion of to-morrow, belief
included, is nothing but a case of the inevitable sequence of
ideas."&mdash;This theory Mr. Bain (no hostile critic) annotates as
follows. "The case that is most thoroughly opposed to the
theory of indissoluble association is our belief in the Uniformity
of Nature. Our overweening tendency to anticipate the
future from the past is shown prior to all association; the first
effect of experience is to abridge and modify a strong primitive
urgency. There is, no doubt, a certain stage when association
co-operates to justify the believing state. After our headlong
instinct has, by a series of reverses, been humbled and toned
down, and after we have discovered that the Uniformity, at
first imposed by the mind upon everything, applies to some
things and not to others, we are confirmed by our experience
in the cases where the uniformity prevails; and the intellectual
growth of association counts for a small part of the believing
impetus. Still, the efficacy of experience is perhaps negative
rather than positive; it saves, in certain cases, the primitive
force of anticipation from the attacks made upon it in the
other cases where it is contradicted by the facts. It does not
make belief, it conserves a pre-existing belief." In Mr. Bain's
comment it is worthy of particular remark that he considers
experience less as a foundation, than a <em>test</em> always,&mdash;a <em>limit</em>
sometimes,&mdash;of that law which gives life to all the experimental
sciences. "The uniformity imposed by the mind," he observes,
"applies to some things but not to others." His view, therefore,
places the principle itself in the light of a generality given by
the mind and apprehended as a leading maxim. Its field is
sometimes reasserted,&mdash;sometimes contracted,&mdash;by experience;
but in both cases the effect is a process of discrimination.</p>

<p>In support of this view, it may be fairly urged that a child
calculates on the uniformity of human character and conduct,
to an extent not justified in after life. Any child correctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
expects a stone to fall when thrown into the air, without the
least idea of that special reason for its fall, which can be
mathematically extended to the stars. In like manner, our
very earliest belief in the reality of men and objects outside
us, confuses persons and things as resisting antagonists which
ought to be punished and overcome. Experience, therefore,
brings discrimination. Thus, too, the natural apprehension of
a power above nature, occupies a more defined sphere in our
own old age than the first radiant glimpses of our wondering
upward-springing childhood. And the same may be said of
the world's several eras of religious thinking. Yet, if some
eminent writers are correct in contending that the belief in a
Supreme "<em>Heaven-Father</em>," (so strong in the Aryan<a name="FNanchor_157_187" id="FNanchor_157_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_187" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> family,)
was of extreme antiquity, we must admit that our race's infancy
cherished a more truly Theistic faith, than many intervening
ages of moral degeneracy retained.<a name="FNanchor_158_188" id="FNanchor_158_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_188" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> But, side by side with
this admission, we ought to place <em>two</em> notable facts,&mdash;<em>first</em> that
our sense of the supernatural has really educated the great
heart of Man; teaching him from the love of God to love his
neighbour likewise.&mdash;<em>Next</em>,&mdash;that the awful impression has, on
the whole, grown with his growth, and strengthened with his
strength; acquiring fresh light and beauty with every fresh
access to his noblest illumination. Exactly in proportion, as
man increasingly learns to love and live for his neighbour, he
has always increased the depth and earnestness with which he
lives for and loves his God. In these two facts is bound up
the secret of our Western civilization.</p>

<p>We must return, however, for a few paragraphs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
general consideration of what may be called our pre-rational
beliefs.<a name="FNanchor_AE_189" id="FNanchor_AE_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_189" class="fnanchor">[ae]</a> That they are pre-rational (account for them as we
will), is evident since from them spring our first tendencies to
reason in special directions, and our first ability to receive and
assimilate such mental food as may be afforded us. "The
primary facts of intelligence,"&mdash;says Sir W. Hamilton, "the
facts which precede, as they afford the conditions of, all knowledge,&mdash;would
not be original were they revealed to us under
any other form than that of natural or necessary beliefs."<a name="FNanchor_159_190" id="FNanchor_159_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_190" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> A
central point this; and one most essential for the Psychologist!
Indeed, every one who explains such beliefs into laws of
association, commits the oversight of refining away the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
fact involved in those laws themselves. For, the very idea
of association presupposes a guiding impulse. How can we
classify without a standard of classification, arrange or connect
without threads of connection or arrangement? Laws of
association must cluster round an associating principle, just as
translucent halos encircle the Sun. Laws of association do not
make principles; but an operative principle evokes associations,
and manifests itself in their law.</p>

<p>Oversights like this, and the one before noted by Mr. Bain,
are examples of the paralogism incident to all attempts at
explaining the inexplicable. In his eagerness, the metaphysical
refiner subtilizes away the truth under analysis. Even so, in
days of old, Alchemists used to sublimate the gold intended for
transmuting inferior metals, till it flew off in elastic vapour,
and all that <em>had been</em> precious, vanished from the eager
speculative man. A frequent issue this, to searchers after our
true philosopher's stone.</p>

<p>The catalogue of pre-rational beliefs or impulses to believe,
is considerable, and might easily be enlarged. But there is
much to hinder a full enumeration. In the first place, they
emerge from a border-land between the brute and the man;
and border territories are proverbially fertile in disputes.
Next, they have to be sought out and examined in the birthplace
of intelligence; and the beginnings of knowledge like
the beginnings of history are overshadowed by a twilight haze.
Then, too, amongst the painters of human nature, (who after
all are but men,) there prevails a disinclination to confess how
largely our human life is cradled under the rule of unreason
and impulsiveness. Most of us hardly know why we act, yet,
every one likes to believe himself reasoning and reasonable.
Finally, some religious minds shrink back from realizing the
idea of an <em>instinctive</em> belief in the moral antithesis of Right
and Wrong, or in a Supreme First Cause and Judge of all men.
They feel as if to admit it were almost degrading to Faith,&mdash;forgetful
that the philosophic Apostle took this view and
expressed it with the utmost boldness.<a name="FNanchor_160_191" id="FNanchor_160_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_191" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Forgetful, also, that
from whatever source Man's reason sprang, from the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
welled forth every bright stream of practical activity,&mdash;impelling
him to work in spheres as yet unconquered by the
force of his own understanding.</p>


<p>The hindrances now described are, after all, grounded on
an inadequate conception of the true distinction between the
Animal and the Man. Apart from the fact that ultimate
objects of instinct differ as widely as the idea of a future life
differs from the poorest enjoyments of the brute world,&mdash;quite
apart from all consideration of aims and ends,&mdash;the impulses
themselves are in their own activities very far indeed from
occupying the same level. There are instincts of the utmost
importance to all self support and self protection, and to the
sustenance and care of others, which appear in their own
nature simple and unalterable;&mdash;unerring within their direct
line, but beyond it helpless and narrow in their field of
operation. Other instincts again,&mdash;such, for example, as
impel animals to construction, and human beings to art,&mdash;are
evidently influenced and enlarged by intelligence. Beavers
adapt their dams, birds their nests, and the bee her comb, to
all kinds of circumstances, so far as they can command the
means of adaptation. Their intelligence also delights itself
in different kinds of adornment.<a name="FNanchor_161_192" id="FNanchor_161_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_192" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> But the power of meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
exigencies, is manifestly limited throughout the lower creation.
The bee has, for ages, worked upon marvellously accurate
principles, unintelligible to mathematicians before the calculus
was invented, and only fully explained of late years. She
always erects one effectual and skilful kind of barricade<a name="FNanchor_162_193" id="FNanchor_162_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_193" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
against hostile swarms, as well as that dreaded assailant, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Death's head moth. Furthermore, she evinces readiness in
fitting all her material structures to place, occasion, and circumstance.
Yet, observe the same bee exhausting herself by
vain struggles against the sloping roof of a greenhouse, of
which every window is thrown wide open. She perseveres,
hour after hour, in unavailing endeavours to escape by her
one accustomed upward track of flight, unable to conceive the
possibility of transparent but impenetrable glass; and incapable
of learning the fact by her repeated disappointments.
In this way, hundreds of bees, butterflies, and other winged
insects, perish miserably every summer. So, too, the highly
educated and intelligent dog, will try to scratch holes in hard
flag stones, and, after trials innumerable, still scratches on
without seeming to discover that he never succeeds in making
a single hole. Thus, also, birds in captivity keep up the
perpetual motion of their heads&mdash;(useful to the poor prisoner
no longer!) and generations after generations of captives
maintain the instinctive practice. Numberless instances
might easily be adduced to the same effect. But <em>no</em> similar
observation holds good of man. The child soon discontinues
its efforts to thrust an arm through a glass window; and
every day learns some new lesson in the properties of material
objects. The engineer builds dams as well as the beaver;&mdash;but,
beside dams, what marvels innumerable does he achieve
with his earthworks, his timbers, and his stones! Speaking
generally, we perceive that man has an instinctive tendency
to lay hold of a practical fact, idea, and law of action, as a
concrete whole;<a name="FNanchor_163_194" id="FNanchor_163_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_194" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>&mdash;seizing it, at first, as the animal does
without being able to analyze, recompound, or extend it. But
reason holds the candle to instinct.<a name="FNanchor_AF_195" id="FNanchor_AF_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_195" class="fnanchor">[af]</a> The impulse deepens
and widens,&mdash;becomes distinguished by boldness and comprehensive
breadth;&mdash;and it is difficult, if not impossible, to
fix boundaries to its ultimate expansion. An expansion
coextensive with the completed destinies of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>We say thus much of our lower instincts, transformed and
made glorious by reason shining through them; just as the
setting sun transforms and glorifies the clouds floating high
overhead, or the half-translucent foliage of the grove in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
we walk. But there belong exclusively to Man, instinctive
beliefs, impulses, and ideas, which possess a glory of their own;&mdash;raise
him, <em>first</em> above the brutes,&mdash;<em>next</em> above himself as he
now exists,&mdash;and make him know that he may aspire to become
the denizen of a brighter world than this. Among them,
is the feeling that Nature herself is (like the tree or cloud
illumined by the sun), everywhere penetrated by a beauty and a
power streaming through her;&mdash;compared with the reality of
which she is but a filmy veil,&mdash;or it may be an illusive image.
The sun himself, the light and life of the lower world, symbolizes
an existence more truly kindling and ensouling, which
animates and makes brilliant the blue arch of sky. Such
thoughts as these haunted the first utterances of our race,&mdash;and
it needed but another step to make us feel that this living
light shines within ourselves,&mdash;and that, go where we will, a
strength and Majesty go with us, which are not of the earth,
earthy. Thus, the consciousness grew upon Man that his
inner being glows with a radiance more sparkling than the
stars, to which he lifts his bodily eyes. By-and-bye, he
learned to think of the heaven within him, as symbolic also;&mdash;and
to cherish a trembling trust that, when he dies, its
brightness will grow pale, and vanish away only by reason of
a glory which excelleth.</p>

<p>The Apostle beloved of his Master, told us of a true Light
that lighteth every man. Yet, we might have been slow to
realize the purer splendours over-arching our human soul, if
they had not autotyped themselves on the language we commonly
speak. Perhaps, a more convincing proof still to some
of us, is what every now and then becomes incidentally
known;&mdash;the God-ward impulses of a happily developed
childhood, under circumstances favourable to the growth of
"natural piety." In the heart of a child, feelings like those
we have described, dwell untutored, as in their native and
and appropriate home. An awe and dread accompany them
amongst the world of men, but to the child they are never
overpowering or oppressive. His finely-strung imagination
works painlessly. The voices he hears when no human voice
speaks, cause him no fear;&mdash;they call to him from a region
towards which his young soul springs up. They soothe him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
with sensations of hope and peace and love unutterable. This
yearning affection for things unseen, makes the deepest joy of
a happy childhood; it is a reason why Christ said, "Of such
is the kingdom of Heaven."</p>

<p>A beautiful childhood is a very beautiful reality. Partly
because of the exquisite simplicity which tones down and
harmonizes all its impulses. But, very often, its beauty is
only known in its loss;&mdash;and we mourn in after years over
hope, love, and peace, broken down by life's attrition;&mdash;yet
fair to look upon, even in their ruins.<a name="FNanchor_AG_196" id="FNanchor_AG_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_196" class="fnanchor">[ag]</a></p>

<p>No one is likely to doubt that the belief we have been
describing, is peculiar to and characteristic of Man. A
more subtle question would be this;&mdash;Suppose it could be
taken away, how nearly would Man and brute approach each
other?<a name="FNanchor_164_197" id="FNanchor_164_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_197" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> A question deserving the attention of every one,
who lives</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"In self-adoring pride securely mailed."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Probably, the proudest of mankind little think how deeply
their culture, art, and refinement, are indebted to a faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
shared by the lowliest. One point, at least, seems clear,&mdash;if
Morality did not perish in the wreck, a true and independent
moral sense would bring us back to a belief in
our own souls, their immortality, and their God.</p>

<p>Another question more essential to our purpose has been
buried under heaps of fallacy and misconception. Theists
are often told that the ideas of a Deity,&mdash;a future life,&mdash;and
generally all that is conceived as supernatural, have no
absolute trustworthiness;&mdash;they are not self-evident axioms,
and they cannot be demonstrated. One answer to these
alleged difficulties has been implicitly given in the last
Chapter. If such objections are valid at all, they are valid
against every practical first-truth therein considered. They
are valid against <em>all</em> primary practical truths, looked at from
the theoretical side, and tested by the rules proper to what is
called pure Reason;&mdash;Reason, that is to say, not applied, but
speculative. But, then, it is from this very employment of
tests upon truth not <i lang="la">in pari materia</i>, that the first stage of
fallacy begins. The <em>second</em> step in error follows naturally from
the first. Compared with the clearness and definition of mathematics,
all other axioms and proofs appear dim and dubious.
The consequence is, that our minds fall into trains of false
comparison on the all-important subject of certitude. Errors
of that kind are always growing mischiefs; our tongues follow
the lead of our thoughts, and hazy thinking becomes hazy
speaking. Not only so, but words develope themselves into
the leaders of thought; and hazy speaking engenders a hazier
thinking still. People take mathematical certainty to be the
sole type of all true and valuable certainties. Practical maxims
are spoken of, as merely probable, Right and Wrong as the
efflux of moral sentiments.<a name="FNanchor_165_198" id="FNanchor_165_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_198" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Few seem to be aware <em>how</em> the
philosophical arrangements of first-truths ought to be applied.
They should be applied to discriminate the <em>processes</em>, by
which various kinds of truths are discoverable;&mdash;they stamp
a character upon them, when discovered; but they do <em>not</em>
determine the intrinsic worth and validity of the discoveries.</p>

<p>Why, let us ask, does Mathematical truth occupy so lofty a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
position? Because, <em>first</em>, the constitution of our nature obliges
us to accept its axioms, and by consequence each successive
step in its impregnable demonstrations. <em>Next</em>, because we can
verify so many of its theorems objectively. We apply them to
remote planetary and stellar spheres beyond our own reach;
where our own minds can neither alter nor colour anything.
What then ought to be the fair and legitimate inference from
an issue magnificently tried throughout the celestial universe?
Surely this, and no other. It confirms, in the very highest
possible degree, the truth-telling power of our own human
nature. Whatsoever our mental constitution clearly compels
us to accept, that same we ought to hold true, and maintain
unswervingly.</p>

<p>Henceforth, therefore, we ought to look upon our Reason as
having been put upon its conclusive trial. Every year that
passes renders the verdict if possible more triumphant. We
ought, henceforth, to make our assent absolute and unhesitating
in the case of those other truths, which, while things
continue as they now are, can never be tried and confirmed
by an appeal of the same description.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see how opposite would have been the
issue from an employment of improper tests;&mdash;the test, for
instance, of the <em>Unthinkable</em>. The universe, we should then
have said, must be thought of as finite or as infinite. Either
way it is inconceivable;&mdash;therefore the Universe cannot exist
objectively at all.</p>

<p>Vicious as such a process would be, it is not so faulty as that
of confounding the proper methods and attestations of speculative
and practical truth.<a name="FNanchor_166_199" id="FNanchor_166_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_199" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Our human consciousness must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
in <em>both</em> cases give our data. We have to ask and obtain its
answers,&mdash;but, in the two different spheres of knowledge, we
must frame our interrogatories differently, and expect assurances
differing not in <em>degree</em> of certainty, but in <em>kind</em>;&mdash;in
<em>value</em> to human action;&mdash;and in the <em>mode</em> of their deliverance.
We inquire into Speculative truth by <em>analysing</em> it, until we
arrive at undemonstrable axioms which assert their own
validity. We assure ourselves that Practical principles are
true by following them in their <em>synthetic</em> growth. Do they
spring from a maxim we find ourselves urged by our own
nature to accept,&mdash;and the opposite of which we cannot but
broadly reject;&mdash;and do they really <em>work</em> in the world,&mdash;exert
an ennobling influence within their own domain, and
intertwine themselves with the other truths and activities of
our human life? If so, we may be assured of their vitality
and their certitude. We know them, in short, by their
stringency,&mdash;and by a happy experience of their power.
Consequently, our knowledge ought to grow and strengthen,
as our human age and the world's age both roll on. Practical
truth, thus tried and acknowledged, is indeed the silver thread
which leads us always. Some shrink from trusting it when
stretched across the grave; yet, without it, all beyond is lost
in haze, and our present life becomes enigmatical and self-contradictory.</p>

<p>Let us then apply the tests (found valid in their own
practical sphere) to the case of our belief in a Supernatural
and supreme Power. But, that we may do so with more
evident effect, it will be well to place in juxtaposition with
it <em>another</em> powerful belief, and our progress will be rendered
easier if we fix upon one which has already been, in part
at least, under discussion. Nothing seems better fitted for
this purpose, than what Professor Masson calls "the paramount
fact," resulting alike to Hamilton and to Mill,&mdash;the
universal persuasion in men of their own existence, as beings
distinct from, but related to, an external world around them.
It will be observed that, thus described, the fact is of a most
concrete sort,&mdash;our inner reality in relation to an outer reality,&mdash;just
as believing in a Supreme Being we believe in a Power
that holds solemn relations to our individual selves and to
our common Humanity.</p>

<p>We have therefore to observe the impression made upon
our human endowment of practical Reason, when looking face
to face at these two fact-beliefs, which for brevity's sake we
shall call the <em>Natural</em> and the <em>Supernatural</em>.</p>

<p>Did the uninstructed and stammering childhood of our
race, separate, in thought, the <em>Supernatural</em> from surrounding
nature? Can we absolutely say either yes or no to this
inquiry? The "Heaven-Father" of pre-historic<a name="FNanchor_AH_200" id="FNanchor_AH_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_200" class="fnanchor">[ah]</a> day would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
seem if fully considered to make the separation clear. The
type-idea, thus outlined, is drawn, not from symbolizing and
personified Nature, but from an actual, living, fatherly, Man.
And the tendency of primitive Man might rather be to raise
natural objects into living beings, than to lower persons into
things.</p>

<p>It is so, we are sure, with our children's apprehension of
the <em>Natural</em>. They know a world of persons and things
antagonistic to their own wills and efforts, but they begin by
making the things into <em>persons</em>. A thwarted baby-boy beats
the table, his kitten, and his nurse indifferently. So far as
observation has been extended to the religious apprehensions of
the very young, they would seem to spiritualize the material
universe;&mdash;to behold unseen powers in the changing clouds,
and hear them in the sighing of the wind. Wordsworth's
"Ode on Immortality" is a picture as full of childlike human
truth, as it is of unearthly beauty.</p>

<p>But, as regards <em>both</em> principles, the human train of thought
is nearly similar in its first rise, and grows in definiteness
and expansion by a nearly similar process. A true Man sets
each principle to work, and from its working gathers its real
value and verification.</p>

<p>If the world outside him were a phantastic shadow, the
practical conclusion fairly inferred would be <em>quietism</em>. Bolingbroke
said to King Richard&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">The shadow of your face."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>But, suppose both face and sorrow were themselves only
shadows? What worth in Man's body then,&mdash;what worth
in his soaring mind? The natural issue would be to drift
down the shadowy<a name="FNanchor_167_201" id="FNanchor_167_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_201" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> stream into a darker abyss of Nothingness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p>Speculation<a name="FNanchor_168_202" id="FNanchor_168_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_202" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> must lay down its arms, as powerless against
such a supposition. The evidence of our senses<a name="FNanchor_169_203" id="FNanchor_169_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_203" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> themselves
is resolvable into shadows.</p>

<p>It was not by speculation that our strong Western will
encountered the ideal enigmas of every day life. Act upon
externalities, and they will <em>re</em>act upon you. As a matter of
fact, it is necessary to commence by admitting that the souls
of others are as <em>impenetrable</em> to us, as the material things
into which we cannot force our way. But, things and persons
react upon us <em>differently</em>; and we act upon them in widely
<em>different</em> ways. By an exertion of our will, we can change or
stop a <em>natural</em> tide of inorganic antecedents and consequents
and direct it to our own purposes. <em>Beings</em> like ourselves, we
must allure, manage, inform, and persuade. Soon we find, by
experience, that other human beings are very like ourselves;
and the higher animals nearer to us than stocks and stones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
We find this through the exercise of our own causal activities
upon them.</p>

<p>The idea of the <em>Supernatural</em> marches along no very dissimilar
route. The strong man subjects Nature, but the Supernatural
is above both it, and him. He cannot even <em>possess</em> the
thought of the Supreme. Whether he will or no, it <em>possesses
him</em>. To his reason, Nature cannot subsist, as the true and
independent ground of anything;&mdash;her laws are the servants
of his volition;&mdash;and her chain of antecedent and consequent
hangs between a First and a Last, without giving any sufficient
account of either. If the Universe began in a shining Nebula,
the question remains unsolved,&mdash;what first brought the thin
cloud into being? The practical Reason, confirmed by experience,
distinctly perceives that productive nature transforms
all things,&mdash;but originates nothing;&mdash;that, contrariwise, when
human nature wills to commit a wrong,&mdash;it really <em>originates</em>
the crime. A disputant may assert that Man's will originates
no act;&mdash;the criminal is never guilty,&mdash;and the judge and jury
who try him are not answerable for their own decision. The
same disputant may add that the Court in which, they sit is
unreal, and their bodily persons only shadows. The one set
of suppositions is as tenable as the other, and precisely as
unpractical.</p>

<p>In the common course of Nature, then, Mankind has learned
to maintain, as a truth of reason, that the Supernatural Power
is a Will,&mdash;that is a Personality. In other words Man becomes
a Theist.</p>

<p>As in Natural Realism, so in realistic Theism, we try how
our principles will <em>work</em>. Realists in thought, we treat men
and things as natural realities; diverse when compared together,
but alike in outsideness as they stand related to ourselves.
Action and reaction then go on as are to be expected.
Life seems to us one long verification of the truth we began
by accepting.&mdash;And so, too, it is with our belief in a Being
Supernatural and Divine. If we succeed in figuring to ourselves
a world of adaptation, order, law, progress, unity, we
have but to open our eyes, and it appears spread out before
us. If we think that the world's creation would blend all
<em>physical</em> needs into pleasurable pursuits and satisfactions, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
may look and see the union accomplished. If we frame a
scheme of trial and <em>moral</em> discipline, to raise the feeble and
confirm the strong, its realization is not wanting amongst us.
From our own feelings, we can imagine how a Father's eye
would look pityingly down upon fear and sorrow, and all the
strains incidental to moving laws; the attrition of other wills,
the tumults, failures, ill doings, and perversities of our sensitive
and social existence. How a Father's hand would bind up all
that is weak, wild, and wilful in his children, with threads of
rainbow coloured hope and joyful anticipation; bidding them
believe that ere long the uncertain dimness, which is as
morning spread upon the mountains, shall brighten into steady
splendour, shining on to a perfect and unclouded day.</p>

<p>We find as a matter of fact that this hope is no stranger to
the human breast; that numbers live in it; numbers have
died for it; and pre-eminently those of whom the world was
not worthy.</p>

<p>The growth of thought from a bare idea of the Supernatural
to a belief in a pure and sublime Theism,&mdash;and the sufficient
account it renders of the world, ourselves, and our destinies,
must be looked upon as matters of fact in the work-day
history of mankind. Practical human reason has really
travelled by this track, and, from day to day, perceives new
truths to verify the old conclusion. Every attempt to adapt
other theories to the working facts become, by their unfitness
for the purpose, indirect evidence for Theism. How short a
time has passed since Campbell lamented over&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"The hopeless dark Idolater of Chance;"</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>and since the authors of "Rejected Addresses" ridiculed a
system which made the universe an accident.<a name="FNanchor_170_204" id="FNanchor_170_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_204" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>&mdash;<em>Now</em>, chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
sounds as strangely in scientific ears as Fate did to our strong-willed
forefathers. Next, came that unintelligible contradictory
phrase, a "<em>blind intelligence</em>;" a thing called a <em>mind</em>, that
goes it knows not whither, and moves it knows not why.
From this thing, immersed in the darkest ignorance, and
unconscious even of its own existence, we were asked to
believe that arrangement, harmony, excellence, beauty, were
the productions. No wonder if men soon concluded that
a moving force,&mdash;material and soulless,&mdash;would equally fulfil
the same exalted functions. And, surely, one <em>thing</em> is an
account of the Universe as reasonable and as sufficient as
the other.</p>

<p>If we place a non-theistic theory in relation to our human
inner nature, there ensues the same monstrous incongruity.
The plenitude of loveliness, which overflows creation, as it
were with multitudinous waves of light, we are asked to
think of as the work of blind non-being. But, there is a
greater plenitude of loveliness, in the good and noble acts,
words, and thoughts of one bright soul of heaven-aspiring
Man. Must we, then, believe that truth, sincerity, justice,
rightness, goodness, purity, are all the offspring of a something
infinitely lower than our weakest human will?<a name="FNanchor_171_205" id="FNanchor_171_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_205" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>&mdash;Is that unknown
something to be also the beacon of our hopes, the refuge
of each forlorn and shipwrecked brother, the happiness giving
itself to satisfy the unsatisfied aspirations of our long-enduring
hearts?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>
<p>Surely, the mockery of madness could go no further. What
can the morally impotent or the morally imperfect do for us?
Even to the careless eye of common sense, it is clear at a
glance, that with the <em>Impersonal</em> our distinctive spiritual life
can have no possible relations. If this be so, the very first
idea of Supernatural Power is not advanced.&mdash;Contrariwise,
it is distorted, frustrated, nullified. And with it is destroyed
our trust in our own conscious nature. The instinct of immortality
lives and moves within us only to betray.&mdash;Man,&mdash;whose
being is the highest reason for the world's whole
being,&mdash;is henceforth a palpable inconsistency. There cannot
in the dreams of fiction be found a stranger tissue of more
startling,&mdash;or one might venture to say,&mdash;more revolting
moral absurdities. And a moral absurdity contradicts the
constitution of Man's mind, quite as thoroughly as an absurdity
purely intellectual. It is, in reality, the most self-condemned
of all conceivable contradictions.</p>

<p>Let us place side by side with this issue, <em>first</em>, the commonly
conceived relation between a Personal supreme Being and his
creation;&mdash;<em>secondly</em>, the apprehension of Theistic truth within
the soul, as it comes to us substantiated by religious men. We
shall, at all events, gain the advantage of a strong contrast
between Theism and non-Theism;&mdash;and strong contrast with
shadows is often a strong enlightenment.</p>

<p>First, then, to consider the idea of Creation as the work not
of a blind thing, but a supremely wise and powerful Being.
It is plain that (to say the very least) this idea is encompassed
with slighter and fewer difficulties. If a doubter is not convinced
by the ordinary argument from Design, he cannot avoid
admitting the fact of its possibility;&mdash;that it is applicable, and
has been applied, argued, and reargued, without any overwhelming
rejoinder or refutation. And there are <em>two</em> obvious
reasons why it has never been successfully refuted. One&mdash;the
evident truth that, whatever rival theories<a name="FNanchor_172_206" id="FNanchor_172_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_206" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> might or might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
not be expected to do, this theory explains the world. Next&mdash;that
no other attempted explanations have ever found a
First ground for any existing thing. In the theory of Design
it continues an open question how far we may conceive the
Creator's first act as a grand finality,&mdash;the launch of a vast
assemblage of worlds formed,&mdash;or, being formed;&mdash;so built
upon law and guided by far-stretching wisdom, that the
Universe sails gloriously through the Ocean of Space like
a thing of Life; each breath of Force, each wave of Time
wafting it securely on. But, let any idea of a true creation
be admitted, and no belief in existing laws of any kind, will
ever banish the great and good God from the world which He
has created and made. His presence adds glory to its fabric,
and, when we walk in its garden of delights, we feel that He
walks and speaks there too.<a name="FNanchor_173_207" id="FNanchor_173_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_207" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The argument from Creation to Creator forms the subject of
the next Chapters. Therefore, we press it no farther here.</p>

<p>The point to be remembered now, is that this line of reasoning
has alone offered a tenable explanation of the world's
existence. And a like remark holds good of Natural Realism
as opposed to Speculative Idealism. It is impossible (as we
have seen), to prove or disprove either by bare argumentative
abstractions. But, as a question of practical reason, the Natural
Realist explains the outer world of individual existences, and
his explanation tallies both with its phenomena and our own
relations to them. Our material progress (that antithesis of
oriental quietism), depends upon activities we should never
have exerted had we not fully believed in a world of working
energy within ourselves, and an outside world of reacting
forces for us to work upon.</p>

<p>From mere material progress, let us turn our eyes to the
nobler civilization of Mankind. A respect for human life
because it <em>is</em> human,&mdash;honour paid to all men, inasmuch as
manhood possesses an intrinsic title to honour,&mdash;the desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
do justice and love mercy,&mdash;sympathy with privation, suffering,
and aberration, both moral and intellectual,&mdash;these are the
true elements that soften and improve our race. And they
are pre-eminently the dowry of nations believing in Theism.
Theism is to these spiritual powers what Realism has been to
material powers. Human beings are, by these two agencies,
brought into contact with both the outer and the inner
work of life. And as regards life's central work, the lesson
of history is now what it always has been. To move man
from a lower to a higher sphere, his soul must first be deeply
stirred. And a spiritual stir and movement is the applied
strength of a spiritual power.<a name="FNanchor_AI_208" id="FNanchor_AI_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_208" class="fnanchor">[ai]</a></p>

<p>We propose, then, to see by example, what Theism may be
to mankind. Many examples will not be needed, provided
those selected are typical. We shall therefore choose some
two or three distinctive types.</p>

<p>The task of selection reminds us to protest, once for all,
against the weak and cynical way of illustrating human
nature which threatens to become prevalent. If we want to
see what a true man is, we must not seek his fossil effigies,
by delving into the scanty and disputable records of primæval
savagery,<a name="FNanchor_AJ_209" id="FNanchor_AJ_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_209" class="fnanchor">[aj]</a> and unearthing the crumbled seeds of better
things, which died before coming to perfection. It is like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
estimating the Oak from a mouldy Acorn. It is worse!&mdash;Barbarism
tends to distortion and degeneracy. We might as
wisely pronounce a maimed dwarf with carefully flattened
forehead, the beau ideal of human strength and beauty, as seek
to know the mind of man amid its wrecks and perversities.
We must rather look at our race in its strongest and noblest
development. The healthy acorn grows into a spreading
oak;&mdash;the truly human child becomes, not a crooked dwarf,
but an upright intellectual giant. The investigation of
maimed deformities may have its interest for comparative
purposes, but no ancient Greek nor Hebrew, no modern
European nor American, ought to be painted with lineaments
which are revolting to his higher nature. Let us help the
savage by every means we can, <em>except</em> by asking him to sit
for a <em>model of Humanity</em>. When we do this, we have
assuredly lost our very best reason for helping him at all.</p>

<p>The examples following, no one will doubt to be types
of true and highly developed men. The first, is intended
to shew how Theism stands out before the apprehension of
a Man engaged in searching out <em>abstract</em> truth.</p>

<p>The Philosophy of Sir W. Hamilton has become familiar to
most people, so far as his theory of "the Conditioned" is concerned.
They are aware that his mind dwelt on the speculative
difficulties surrounding a knowledge of the Absolute, the
self-subsisting First Cause, and true Ground of all things.
Yet, to the veracity of God he appeals for the veraciousness
of our primary beliefs. Over against a whole school of
Idealists, he places, as the one fatal objection, this same
veracity&mdash;"Either maintaining the veracity of God, they
must surrender their hypothesis;&mdash;or, maintaining their
hypothesis, they must surrender the veracity of God."<a name="FNanchor_174_210" id="FNanchor_174_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_210" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
if the existence of a Deity is known, there can be no doubt
that His truth is amongst the highest and clearest <em>to us</em>, of
all His essential attributes. We cannot (as Sir William says)
"suppose that we are created capable of intelligence, in order
to be made the victims of delusion; that God is a deceiver,
and the root of our nature a lie."<a name="FNanchor_175_211" id="FNanchor_175_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_211" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Therefore, he drew a
wide distinction between, on the one hand, knowing the
Absolute and the Supreme so as to examine and explain His
nature, and, on the other hand, believing that He truly is, so
as to affirm the fact of His being, and the necessary consequences
of His existence. "When I deny," he writes, "that
the Infinite can by us be <em>known</em>, I am far from denying that
by us it is, must, and ought to be, <em>believed</em>!"<a name="FNanchor_176_212" id="FNanchor_176_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_212" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>&mdash;In this
belief, Sir William saw a sufficient reason for accepting, as
Mr. Mill advises all to accept, "the inexplicable fact." And
indeed the problem of truth perpetually does come, (evade the
conclusion as we will), in one shape or another, to this same
necessity of final acceptance. Mr. Coleridge's <em>Friend</em> is one
long investigation into this necessity, and he fairly closes his
argument by saying that always,&mdash;start from whatever point
we may,&mdash;"reason will find a chasm, which the moral being
only, which the spirit and religion of man alone can fill up."<a name="FNanchor_177_213" id="FNanchor_177_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_213" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>3
For Sir W. Hamilton, Theism bridged the vast abyss! No
one could more strongly estimate its vastness, and the poverty
of our visual powers when we stand beside it;&mdash;the dim feeling
which makes us shrink back from its awful verge. But
Theism became to him the strength of a noble life;&mdash;a life of
much self-sacrifice, and meagre earthly recompense.<a name="FNanchor_AK_214" id="FNanchor_AK_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_214" class="fnanchor">[ak]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p>The next typical thinker we shall quote is one pre-eminent
for his careful study of the constitution of <em>Man</em>, the course,
the aims, and aptitudes of his <em>moral</em> existence. It seems
hardly necessary to add the name of Bishop Butler. The
reader will find pleasure and instruction, if he peruses
Butler's two sermons on the Love of God, from the second
of which the following passages are cited:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nothing is more certain, than that an infinite Being may himself
be, if he pleases, the supply to all the capacities of our nature. All
the common enjoyments of life are from the faculties he hath endued
us with, and the objects he hath made suitable to them. He may
himself be to us infinitely more than all these: he may be to us all
that we want. As our understanding can contemplate itself, and our
affections be exercised upon themselves by reflection, so may each be
employed in the same manner upon any other mind; and since the
supreme Mind, the Author and Cause of all things, is the highest
possible object to himself, he may be an adequate supply to all the
faculties of our souls; a subject to our understanding, and an object
to our affections.</p>

<p>"Consider then: when we shall have put off this mortal body,
when we shall be divested of sensual appetites, and those possessions
which are now the means of gratification shall be of no avail;
when this restless scene of business and vain pleasures, which now
diverts us from ourselves, shall be all over; we, our proper self, shall
still remain; we shall still continue the same creatures we are, with
wants to be supplied, and capacities of happiness. We must have
faculties of perception, though not sensitive ones; and pleasure or
uneasiness from our perceptions, as now we have.</p>

<p>"There are certain ideas, which we express by the words, order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
harmony, proportion, beauty, the furthest removed from anything
sensual. Now, what is there in those intellectual images, forms, or
ideas, which begets that approbation, love, delight, and even rapture,
which is seen in some persons' faces upon having those objects
present to their minds?&mdash;'Mere enthusiasm!'&mdash;Be it what it will:
there are objects, works of nature and of art, which all mankind
have delight from, quite distinct from their affording gratification to
sensual appetites; and from quite another view of them, than
as being for their interest and further advantage. The faculties from
which we are capable of these pleasures, and the pleasures themselves,
are as natural, and as much to be accounted for, as any
sensual appetite whatever, and the pleasure from its gratification.
Words to be sure are wanting upon this subject: to say, that everything
of grace and beauty throughout the whole of nature, everything
excellent and amiable shared in differently lower degrees by the
whole creation, meet in the Author and Cause of all things; this is
an inadequate and perhaps improper way of speaking of the divine
nature; but it is manifest that absolute rectitude, the perfection of
being, must be in all senses, and in every respect, the highest object
to the mind....</p>

<p>".... Now, as our capacities of perception improve,
we shall have, perhaps by some faculty entirely new, a perception of
God's presence with us in a nearer and stricter way; since it is certain
he is more intimately present with us than anything else can be.
Proof of the existence and presence of any being is quite different
from the immediate perception, the consciousness of it. What then
will be the joy of heart, which his presence, and <em>the light of his countenance</em>,
who is the life of the universe, will inspire good men with,
when they shall have a sensation, that he is the sustainer of their
being, that they exist in him; when they shall feel his influence to
cheer and enliven and support their frame, in a manner of which we
have now no conception? He will be in a literal sense <em>their strength
and their portion for ever</em>."<a name="FNanchor_178_215" id="FNanchor_178_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_215" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of the last writer here adduced, it is needless to say more
than that amongst living authors, he is rarely equalled in his
subtle analysis of the <em>tender and emotional side of humanity</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The personal relation sought, is discerned and felt. The Soul
understands and knows that God is <em>her</em> God; dwelling with her
more closely than any creature can; yea, neither Stars, nor Sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
nor smiling Nature hold God so intimately as the bosom of the
Soul. What is He to it? what, but the Soul of the soul? It no
longer seems profane to say, 'God is my bosom friend: God is for
me, and I am for Him.' So Joy bursts out into Praise, and all things
look brilliant; and hardship seems easy, and duty becomes delight,
and contempt is not felt, and every morsel of bread is sweet....</p>

<p>".... But Oh philosopher, is all this a contemptible dream?
thou canst explain it all? or thou scornest it all? Whatever
<em>theory</em> thou may'st form concerning it, it is not the less a fact
of human nature: one of some age too: for David thirsted after
God and exceedingly rejoiced in Him, and so did Paul; and the
feelings which they describe are reproduced in the present day.
To despise wide-spread enduring facts is <em>not</em> philosophic; and
when they conduce to power of goodness and inward happiness,
it might be wise to learn the phenomena by personal experience,
<em>before</em> theorizing about them. It was not a proud thing of Paul
to say, but a simple truth, that the spiritual cannot be judged
by the unspiritual.</p>

<p>"The single thought, 'God is for my soul, and my soul
is for Him,' suffices to fill a universe of feeling, and gives rise
to a hundred metaphors. Spiritual persons have exhausted human
relationships in the vain attempt to express their full feeling of
what God (or Christ) is to them. Father, Brother, Friend, King,
Master, Shepherd, Guide, are common titles. In other figures,
God is their Tower, their Glory, their Rock, their Shield, their
Sun, their Star, their Joy, their Portion, their Hope, their Trust,
their Life."<a name="FNanchor_179_216" id="FNanchor_179_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_216" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Such is Theism, penetrating the head and heart of Man;
appealing to his intellect, his conscience, and his affections.
Such is Theism; sending upwards, out of Man's spirit, aspirations
which "dumb driven cattle" cannot breathe&mdash;often the
sole sweet incense from Earth to Heaven. It is possible that,
to some readers, the passages extracted will sound like the
accents of a foreign tongue. Of such it may properly be
asked, whether any man has a right <em>so</em> to call in question
another sane man's honest consciousness, <em>as</em> to deny its reality,
worth, and excellence? There are ears on which the music
of Shakespeare's words, or Mozart's notes, fall tuneless and
unmeaning. Yet, who on that account would deny the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
sense and delight of poetry, rhythm, and melody? We
cannot, in reason, forget that even from ordinary men a small
amount of affirmation, if conscientious, unselfish, and collected,
outweighs and annihilates a host of perplexing doubts. But,
every great Man's thought is at least a grand fact; every
expression of it a benefaction to his fellow-men. And, as
respects the mighty power with which Theism stirs and impels
the soul, we may rest absolutely assured that, where one
human being is found to give it utterance, thousands have felt
the movement, and have silently governed their life's work by
it. Happily, the brightest gifts of our existence are also the
commonest;&mdash;the sunshine of the world, and the sunshine of
the Soul.</p>

<p>Countless numbers have, indeed, professed to discern by an
inward sense the reflected reality of a Supreme Being. They
who feel it most deeply, do not attempt to explain the Substance
of which an imperfect copy exists within themselves,
acknowledged, yet inexplicable; at once the greatest enigma,
and the noblest fact of their essential being. They are content
to look upwards to the Supreme Mind they have found;&mdash;to
treasure such knowledge as they have; and adore its
object. Many of those who have thus believed and acted are
amongst the most excellent and perfect of our race.</p>

<p>Has any theory of the Universe which ignores the original
of an image discovered within ourselves, accounted for what
we perceive through our senses, our consciousness, and our
moral insight,&mdash;so well as <em>that</em> theory which acknowledges
and reverences a God?</p>

<p class="center">SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="hang">The argument of this chapter turns upon the analysis of concrete
processes carried on throughout human life; together with their
correlations or correspondent factors visible <i lang="la">in rerum naturâ</i>. All
these being complex activities, resolve themselves into series of
simpler activities, which, though separable in thought, follow each
other inseparably as real working elements of human or natural
productions,&mdash;or of both.</p>

<p class="hang">In each productive process of Mankind, we perceive:&mdash;</p>



<p class="hang">1. A purpose conceived,&mdash;(the end or final cause.)</p>

<p class="hang">2. A power or force which has to be (a.) discovered and (b.) fitted to
this human purpose.</p>

<p class="hang">2. (a.) This implies that the object in quest exists, or is capable of being
evoked into active existence, as a Force or operative Law capable
of producing real effects. Otherwise, it would be no auxiliary to
Man. Viewed <em>per se</em>, and apart from its being fitted to his special
purpose, it must therefore be a <em>natural</em> power or law, and answers
to what Bacon calls a Form or Formal cause.<a name="FNanchor_180_217" id="FNanchor_180_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_217" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p class="hang">(It is plain that human production requires some particular utilization
of a producing force, wider in itself than this or any other
ancillary application of its energies. Compare Bacon's philosophic
observation<a name="FNanchor_181_218" id="FNanchor_181_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_218" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> that the operative Form "deduces the given nature
from some source of being which is inherent in more natures.")</p>

<p class="hang">2. (b.) A number of such powers, forces, laws, forms, present themselves
to the intellectual eye of an inventor or producer. Possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
<em>fitness</em>, (adaptability)&mdash;must therefore next be determined. And
here the power is no longer considered separately, but in relation
to some Formation.</p>

<p class="hang">In 2, therefore, we have (a) a simple fact or general law of Force;&mdash;and
(b) a correlated fact, or specialized law of Production.</p>

<p class="hang">3. Finally, for operative activity, there must be an efficient cause putting
in movement the productive law, over and above its intelligent
apprehension just presupposed. This efficient Cause, as seen always
in human Production, is a Will.</p>

<p class="hang">Now each several step in this series comes before us as an act of <em>Mind</em>.
But out of this number one only needs to be examined here;&mdash;because</p>

<p class="hang">Purpose (1) has been treated of in Chapter II.</p>

<p class="hang">Will (3) occupies the close of this Essay.</p>



<p class="hang">No. 2, therefore, (divisible into a and b,) makes the proper subject-matter
of the present Chapter. It has been written to meet the
difficulties felt by a certain number of reasoners respecting the
argument from Design. They are very often indisposed to accept
that argument, because its analogical nature makes it appear
circuitous; and because they hesitate when attempting to appreciate
its exact value: compare p. 53 <i>ante</i>. There is also a lurking dread
of that spectral shadow called Anthropomorphism, haunting some
minds with a pertinacity, which may be estimated from p. 54 <i>seq.</i>
By such reasoners let the present Chapter,&mdash;which proceeds not by
way of analogy, but through a direct analysis of acknowledged facts&mdash;be
read as a substitute for Chapter II. Or, they may if they
please, consider the present and two following Chapters as a Treatise
entirely distinct from the rest of the volume; this present Chapter
serving as a brief statement of the case for <em>physico-</em>theology; while
the two arguments ensuing sketch out <em>Ethico-</em> or <em>Moral</em> Theology;
on which complementary modes of thought see p. 107 <i>ante</i>, together
with text and notes now about to follow. Finally, by all those who
accept the reasoning from Design as already explained, let both it
and our other various lines of argument be treated as separate
evidences of Natural Theology, each resting on its own grounds, but
all consilient at last.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Analysis.</i>&mdash;Advance and Retrogression of Discovery and of Civilization.
Progress dependent on realizing the relativity between Power and
Function. This condition of success is examined at length.</p>

<p class="hang">Perception of existing Relations, and creation of new ones by human
Reason and Will. Illustrations from histories of Invention, Art,
Education, and Self-Education.</p>

<p class="hang">Production of Change within ourselves. Self conquest, Self formation,
and Re-formation. Inability of animals arises from domination of
motives unalterable by themselves and instinctively apprehended.
Training relative to motor instincts of various sorts. Self-training
requires freedom from the domination of any single unbalanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
or unalterable impulse. It implies the power of using motives as
counterpoises, and of introducing new elements into the sphere of
our ideals.</p>

<p class="hang">Influence of human presence upon the education of animals; influence
of the Divine Idea upon Man.</p>

<p class="hang">Transition from the sphere of Intellect to that of Will in relation to the
World. The Spring of Production a movement of Will; the Idea of
Production an insight into the Mind of Nature; discovered not
logically, but as shewn in operation in Nature. Law and Idea,
Intelligence and Matter. Manifold Forces imply a central Unity.
Putting aside the analogical inference from apparent Purpose, the
question of operative Law (Force, Form, Mind,) is examined in its
many activities, their correlations and their underlying Oneness.</p>

<p class="hang">Natural Law in action: hypothesis of limited intelligence. Case of
Unreason, Creation by Chance.</p>

<p class="hang">Breadth of Law seen in its general fitnesses, and grander unities. Exceptional
effects in "Functioning."</p>

<p class="hang">Character of Mind in Nature. Law, type, idea. Adaptation even if
purposed is not Arbitrary. A Supreme Will must be a sovereign
Reason.</p>

<p class="hang">Perfection of Mind in Nature estimated from convergent fitnesses and
correlations, as exemplified by Sight and Hearing. Also by their
effects in producing Beauty, Happiness, and a sense of sympathy.
Mind in Nature not bare intelligence, but possessing emotional
attributes, not harsh nor unlovely, but tender and loveable.</p>

<p class="center">PRODUCTION AND ITS LAW.</p>


<p>"Life," said Dr. Johnson, "has not many things better than
this:"&mdash;"we were," Boswell explains, "driving rapidly along
in a post-chaise." But what if the two men, congratulating
themselves upon their speed, could have read (with some
approach to second-sight) Dr. Darwin's lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Soon shall thy arm, unconquer'd steam! afar</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car.</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Or on wide-waving wings expanded bear</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">The flying chariot through the fields of air."</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The slow barge now traverses the wide Atlantic as fast as
even fast-living America can desire. The rapid car whirls
across England in a few brief hours. With what half-envious
astonishment, might Dr. Johnson have computed the arrowy
flight of these iron creations over land or water;&mdash;with what
sententious wisdom might he not have dilated on the uncontrolled
dissemination, Sir, of books, knowledge, and civility;&mdash;to
say nothing of vile whiggism or possible rebellion!</p>

<p>No wide-waving wings have as yet wafted us over rivers
and mountains. But some inventors still cherish a hope of
applying steam steerage, and perhaps steam propulsion, to
very large balloons.</p>

<p>It is curious to think of the many centuries, during which
men saw elastic vapour lifting their kettle lids, without catching
the idea of steam power, or reflecting on the movement
it produced. Curious, too, to remember how slowly the idea
grew, after the Marquis of Worcester had explained the relation
between the power and its movement-producing func<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>tion.
His "fire-water-work" (as he called it), "drove up
water by fire," at a rate of 1250 lbs. through one foot, to
the consumption of 1 lb. of coal. This is about 200 times the
waste of a good modern engine. But the <em>principle</em> was there.
Water flowed without intermission, at a height of forty feet,
driven only by the elastic force of steam. The introduction
of atmospheric pressure half obscured the original conception;
steam-power seemed in danger of losing its proper functions.
Passing by Papin and Savery,<a name="FNanchor_182_219" id="FNanchor_182_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_219" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> the descent of Newcomen's
piston depended on the production of a vacuum beneath it; at
much cost of heat and labour, much waste of fuel and force.
Strange, that for so many years nobody thought of introducing
steam-power above the piston, as well as below it.</p>

<p>The retrograde path which science sometimes treads, is
also clearly shewn in the long-delayed invention of the
paddlewheel steam-boat. The first patent was taken out
by Jonathan Hulls in 1736, and his rare pamphlet may be
seen at the British Museum, or in Mr. Partington's reprint.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_183_220" id="FNanchor_183_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_220" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
Strange, that so good a thing should have continued so long
neglected;&mdash;up to the days of the first Napoleon, and, (fortunately
perhaps for civilization,) under the Conqueror's imperial
rule. The same fate, however, befel Trevithick's "walking
engine" made in 1802. He applied high-pressure steam-power
to a railway locomotive which really travelled (1805) at
Merthyr Tydvil. Every one knows how slowly this invention
has grown up into the useful goods-train or the luxurious roll
of the express.</p>

<p>The relation between a power so well tested, and propulsion,
was thus long in being fitted with perfect mechanism, and
presented to the eyes of mankind as a familiar every day phenomenon.
But the idea of propelling carriages by other means
than animal sinews, had been working the reverse way; and a
desirable end suggested a search for means. Men tried to fit
other powers to the function; the problem gave rise to wind-driven
chariots, and other curious contrivances for travelling
by land, which are graphically described by Lovell Edgeworth
and several of his contemporaries. Then, too, came
the desire to sail against the wind, and independently of water
currents. A vignette in the first Edition of <cite>Bewick's Birds</cite>
(vol. 1, p. 257), published in 1797, shews us a ferry-boat crossing
a river by means of a windmill which turns paddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
wheels.<a name="FNanchor_184_221" id="FNanchor_184_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_221" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The engraver has marked by a ripple at the vessel's
bows the strength and swiftness with which she stems the
stream.</p>

<p>The history of these machines carries with it a very useful
moral. It furnishes an apt similitude to the delays and retrogressions
which are found in the onward march of mankind,
in the gains and triumphs of civilization. These sometimes
occur to nations through error, violence, and wrong. Compulsory
celibacy, forced upon the most cultured men, was,
according to Mr. Darwin, one cause why Spain, notwithstanding
her great generals, navigators, and inventors,<a name="FNanchor_185_222" id="FNanchor_185_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_222" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> has
been distanced by freer nations. Then, too, as he adds, "the
holy Inquisition selected with extreme care the freest and
boldest men in order to burn or imprison them.&mdash;In Spain
alone, some of the best men ... were eliminated during
three centuries at the rate of a thousand a year.<a name="FNanchor_186_223" id="FNanchor_186_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_223" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The streams
of both invention and human improvement resemble, in this
respect, the current of a mighty river. We always encounter&mdash;and
always ought to expect&mdash;whirlpools, back-waters, and
other sinuosities, as we descend the flowing tide.</p>

<p>Very frequently, civilization is retarded by another kind
of difficulty, also besetting the inventive arts. Like them,
Progress depends upon its capacity for happily realizing the
relativity<a name="FNanchor_AL_224" id="FNanchor_AL_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_224" class="fnanchor">[al]</a> between Power and Function. The philan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>thropist
sometimes,&mdash;the craftsman often,&mdash;has only to think
of the function required, and to grasp a relation pre-existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
in the laws of the natural world,&mdash;fit it to its own purposes,
and usefully employ the adaptation. This was the case when
elastic vapours of many kinds were examined relatively to
their power of producing movement. Each deeper investigation
brings a clearer insight into a more deeply-hidden
law. The apprehension of "Heat as a mode of Motion,"<a name="FNanchor_AM_225" id="FNanchor_AM_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_225" class="fnanchor">[am]</a>
is an instance in point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes&mdash;in human affairs oftenest&mdash;the mind originates
a new relation between Power and Function, and launches it,
like an unimagined locomotive, whirling and dashing onwards
throughout the world of men. The will of a powerful king
or conqueror, statesman or missionary, evokes a new power;
gives it life and motive energy, and sends it out to perform its
intended function amongst millions of mankind, and for many
generations. Hence, Kant said there were two things which
filled him with awe: one, the starry heavens, that mightiest
example of mighty powers orderly performing their appropriate
functions; the other, Man's Will, a power less mighty in one
sense, but belonging to a sphere where mass and measurement
are not, and performing functions signalized too frequently by
wrongful determination. Functions which, whether rightly or
wrongly performed, involve a mightier <em>Something</em> than all
the inorganic worlds ever displayed, a <em>Something</em> we define by
that deepest of ideas and most awful of truths,&mdash;Responsibility.</p>

<p>The whole subject admits of extensive illustration. The
relativities of Power and Function are infinitely varied in
Nature, Art, and Thought; in the unity of the whole world,
and in the disunited world of Humanity. But, however
varied in their sphere of operation, all relations between Power
and Function coincide in one characteristic. They appeal to
mind alone, and by mind alone can be apprehended so as to
become operative. Those that belong to the <em>human</em> sphere of
activity are in part the <em>perceptions</em> of Mind; in part they are
evidenced to our consciousness as its own <em>creations</em>.</p>

<p>If we look at the inorganic world, Man apprehends such a
relativity as that between steam-power and propulsion, and
applies it. In the realm of pure mathematics, there are powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
of another sort, which (when applied) require allowances to be
made in "<em>functioning</em>" them. Provided metal, timber, friction,
and cross-circumstances have their proper margin given,
those abstract entities,<a name="FNanchor_187_226" id="FNanchor_187_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_226" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> absolute in truth, become realized in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
practice. When we come to organization, particularly higher
organisms, the functions of the biological kingdom are more
complex. Yet the trainer of animals knows how to combine
and modify old powers so as to produce new ones. The pointer,
the greyhound, the racehorse, and the hunter are all examples.
Then, too, men manipulate men. See how the face of all
Europe is covered with training establishments of every
description.<a name="FNanchor_AN_227" id="FNanchor_AN_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_227" class="fnanchor">[an]</a> Youths are fitted for army, navy, bar, parlia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>ment,
politics. The powers of attention, memory, habit, are all
pressed into service, just as the inventor of locomotives calculates
the strength and tenacity of iron, brass, copper, and other
materials, fits each pipe, crank, and wheel, to its intended function,
and ends by speeding his fellows past the doors of their
fellow-men. Now, the manipulation of these materials is a
calculable process, and succeeds at last. But there is one disappointment
often awaiting the manipulator of mankind. His
failure arises from the fact that the moral purpose, which he
must take for granted, is very commonly wanting among those
he undertakes to educate.</p>

<p>Another inventor of the highest sort, an artist, conceives a
majestic thought. It becomes to him the work of his life, the
function he ardently desires to realize. To the true Art-man,
his conception is a noble ideal, and some instinct, or proclivity
of his own nature, teaches him how to adapt it to the ears and
eyes, the intellect and feelings of his race. There are sounds
which die in their newborn sensations of delight, yet haunt
the memory while consciousness remains. There are colours
appealing to one single organ of perception, and, through it,
penetrating the soul with images that rise again and again in
nightly and daily dreams. And there are words, the forms
and creations of our distinctive human mind, through which it
exercises its sublimest powers, and which are (in themselves)
among the most sublime. <em>They</em> have their proper functions.
Age after age, from country to country, from nation to nation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_188_228" id="FNanchor_188_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_228" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
they have moved the souls of readers to emotion, reasoning,
will, activity. Noble words, expressing ideas unknown to all
intelligences below man, and called into existence by him, prolong
their own lives by extending his intellectual and affective
life. They burn like incense within the temple of his spirit,
but, unlike incense, survive undyingly in the immortal flame
which kindles them.</p>

<p>There is a still loftier and more solemn function we all exercise&mdash;or
ought to exercise&mdash;in or upon the sphere of our own
souls. To us is committed the task, our human task,&mdash;morally
imperative on no sentient beings inferior to ourselves,&mdash;of transforming
and reforming, that is (to all intents and purposes)
<em>truly forming</em> our own inward nature. We have not, at
present, to consider how near heaven may and does draw to
earth, in this highest of works known to us who dwell beneath
the sky. But the absolutely human part of it belongs to this
place.</p>

<p>Every one has learned how hard it is to break through even
one bad habit. The evil has in most cases enchained body as
well as mind. A drunkard's hand is naturally reached out to
lift the cups it has been used to lift. His thirst, too, recurs at
the accustomed hour;&mdash;and the readers of "Elia" know something
of what happens when it is left unslaked. A tingling
and straining of the palate is associated with the sight of the
eye; the drunkard's throat burns when he sees the draught
before him; his frustrated desire is followed by the most frightful
sufferings throughout his disorganized nervous system.
The same is true of other like habituations; as may be read in
De Quincey's Opium Eater, and in the last book of Charles
Dickens, left behind him an unfinished fragment. It is true,
also, of countless smaller customs which prevent many a man
from achieving what Hooker calls "great masteries." Every
muscle, fibre, and organ of our frame, performs easily the
functions it has been used to perform, but undergoes a strain
if put out of its usual course.</p>

<p>The mind (as well as the body), has its laws of habit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
association. We perceive this fact most readily in the less
perfect intelligence of the animal kingdom, of untutored man,
and of people who are more inured to action than to reflection.
The more rudimentary the mind, the more real is its state of
subservience to association and habit, which may then be properly
termed its governing laws. But it would be improper to
apply this word "governing" to the same laws in connection
with higher natures. In a man whose reason and will have
attained their manly majority, such laws have ceased to be
governors;&mdash;their province is simply administrative. Deposed
from their rule over his existence, they become his ministers,
servants, instruments. There is, thus, a compensatory constitution
of human nature, whereby the light within us, which
lighteth every man, may be said to make us free.<a name="FNanchor_189_229" id="FNanchor_189_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_229" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> It exempts
us, that is, from the sway of customary laws which guide and
reduce to subjection the merely animal intelligence.</p>

<p>A habit broken is a customary law broken. And any one
who breaks through a customary law already inwoven with
the fibres of his own life, is a man <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>. And the
deeper that inweaving,&mdash;the greater the laceration of living
fibres,&mdash;if he rends them in obedience to duty, and because to
do otherwise would be to do wrong, the more truly and emphatically
he is a <em>Man</em>. Again, if we proceed to ask by what
means he breaks the bonds of custom, the Manhood of his act
appears still more distinctly. His purpose may be, and often
is, accomplished by setting a higher law of his being over
against a lower;&mdash;putting a more really human power in
movement to tame and quell some animal propensity. But
then, what is that secret strength which apprehends and
evokes the higher law? What is the central spring that
moves the strictly human power, and converts it from a
sleeping capacity for good, into an acting and living energy?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Clearly, it is the Man's truest humanity;&mdash;the endowment
which makes him Man.</p>

<p>There are lives of men plainly told, and undoubted, where
<em>re</em>-formation,&mdash;that is <em>self</em>-formation,&mdash;appears like a flash of
electric fire. The Will in such men has energized, just as
intellect flashes out in its noblest condition of genius; and can
best be described by the poet or the seer who knows what it
is to create, and new create. These lives more than realize
Cæsar's boast;&mdash;the truly human soul came to itself,&mdash;saw
itself,&mdash;and overcame. The conqueror did a deed which,
(truly done,) was done for ever, and yielded him the presage
of perpetual peace.</p>

<p>Histories of self-conquest do, however, remarkably differ in
respect of the <em>time</em> employed upon the work. Some victories
are, as we have said, rapid and brilliant as the march of
Alexander,&mdash;others slow and embarrassed, like the weary
path of a pilgrim through deserts of rolling sand. But no
pilgrim who is in earnest need despair. Putting aside all
consideration of supernatural aid, he may take courage from
the essential greatness of his own human being, when contrasted
with the being of all creatures below mankind.</p>

<p>The <em>comparison</em> sets out from this question:&mdash;What can
merely animal nature do to raise itself? Man, we know, can
train certain brutes&mdash;he can entrap all;&mdash;but no brute can in
any wise deliver himself from the snare of a single appetite.
The weakness, as well as the strength, of animal intelligence
lies in the vividness of its instincts. Animals appear conscious
of the working of powers within themselves; and they apprehend
those functions, with the performances of which their
powers are correlated. Hence, in part at least, the pleasure
of a bird in nest-building; a bee in storing her comb, or a
predacious creature in its successful pursuit of prey. But the
relation between animal power and function appears so nearly
fixed, as to be hedged round by narrow limits; and only in a
<em>very</em> small degree susceptible of modification. So far as we can
discover, the brute is deficient in the means of self-education,
for <em>three</em> distinct reasons. <em>One</em>, because he cannot escape
fulfilling the normal functions of his unreasoning impulse. In
the <em>second</em> place, because he is unable to overcome the urgency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
of one innate power, by opposing to it the claims and vigour of
another. <em>Thirdly</em>, he can never introduce anything new into
the relativity between power and function. He can command
no spring of high aim or creative thought, which might give
new purpose to his better powers, or open out some further
sphere of activity before unknown.&mdash;Were this possible, he
might lift the functions of his common life above their old
destinies, and above themselves.&mdash;And <em>this</em> would be a work
of self-education.</p>

<p>To pursue our comparison,&mdash;we must remember that the
ability for self-education and the capacity for being educated,
are correlatives; and we may measure the one by the other.
The animal world has never shewn strength enough to raise
itself very high;&mdash;it has never ceased to be distinctly animal.
But, has it ever possessed latent powers for which opportunity
was always wanting? Mankind, for their own purposes, have
(we know) continually been testing<a name="FNanchor_AO_230" id="FNanchor_AO_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_230" class="fnanchor">[ao]</a> the endowments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
inferior creatures. How high, then, can man by his endeavours
raise the animal race?&mdash;He can generally train them to a
greater quickness in the exercise and nicety of their own
instinctive powers, and a more enduring performance of their
instinctively presented functions. By reward and punishment,
he can inure them to some degree of self-restraint; and he
takes advantage of a thousand pretty impulses and fondnesses
of animal nature, to call into being attachment,&mdash;nay, often
passionate devotion,&mdash;towards himself. In this sense, Man has
been styled the God of his domestic brute&mdash;his horse, his dog,
his elephant. It would be a curious subject of reflection, to
inquire what effect might possibly be produced upon the
<em>human</em> mind by the visible presence, and incessant influence,
of beings, as much higher than men, as men are higher than
brutes? The moment we start this idea in our minds, it is
difficult to evade an impression that Man must be a desolate
creature, if he can never in some way see the Invisible.<a name="FNanchor_AP_231" id="FNanchor_AP_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_231" class="fnanchor">[ap]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>To leave this curious point. Nothing appears more really
conclusive against all supposed capacity for <em>great</em> development,
than the history of what are called "learned animals";&mdash;of
the mechanical means necessarily employed for teaching them,
and the mechanical results obtained. There is indeed no better
word to describe the true state of the case; than the term
"mechanical," as opposed to everything that is ideal, or truly
creative.<a name="FNanchor_AQ_232" id="FNanchor_AQ_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_232" class="fnanchor">[aq]</a> If a brute could idealize the laws of outward
nature,&mdash;or the laws connecting his own powers with their
proper functions, he might see them as a Man does, and give
them a fresh existence within his own intelligence. He would
then be able to invent an alphabet, conceive a picture, and
view the properties of outward objects as universals inwardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
apprehended. In this way, he would acquire exemption
from the reign of mechanism, and live a really creative life.
Possible conceptions&mdash;ideal functions&mdash;would require new
powers to realize them;&mdash;and these powers would be searched
for and found. Or, <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, an idealized power,&mdash;a power
seen, (not as it is, but as it may be)&mdash;would lead to the
discovery of fresh functions,&mdash;new fields of enterprise,&mdash;new
realms of imagination.</p>

<p>It is manifest at a glance, how far in fact these conquests
are from the world of creatures, by us, therefore, called unreasoning.
Art, letters, and abstract thought, are no visitants
of the animal sphere. Words cannot come where thoughts
are not; and therefore language, in the <em>human</em> meaning of
language, is unknown to brutes.<a name="FNanchor_190_233" id="FNanchor_190_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_233" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> And no effort made by
Man has ever been successful in sharing with his humble
companions any one&mdash;(much less all) of these attainments.
His artistic sense of Beauty, and power of giving it varied
expression, find no Echo beneath himself; he can in no
wise teach by historical record, poetry, abstract calculation,
or abstract thought. Neither can he impart the true secret
of social sympathy,&mdash;and forbid the stricken deer to weep
and die alone. Intelligence without imagination, cannot
conceive a sorrow so lonely or unseen. Therefore, it knows
little of deep sorrow,&mdash;for even the mortally-wounded bird
will strive to hide its wound.<a name="FNanchor_191_234" id="FNanchor_191_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_234" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, in each and all of these respects, every human being
devoted to self-education starts from the plain fact, that Man
is <em>educable</em>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Parents first season us,&mdash;then schoolmasters."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>The master of many a middle-school has frequent occasion
to say with Horace;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i16">&mdash;&mdash;"At ingenium ingens</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Inculto latet hoc sub corpore."&mdash;</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>And the schoolmaster, also, knows that a little spark will
often light into fire some vast store of emotional as well as
intellectual elements lying asleep within.<a name="FNanchor_192_235" id="FNanchor_192_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_235" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>We therefore speak (if we speak correctly), of educating an
animal in a totally different sense from educating a boy. For,
facts are as we have stated them, whatever theories may be.</p>

<p>There is <em>one</em> more point of contrast to stimulate and encourage
the self-educating portion of Mankind; and this point
is the most characteristic endowment essential to Humanity.
A man is not creative by virtue of his ideals alone, however
bright and beautiful those visions of his intellect may be. He
calls into existence that, which as yet is not, by virtue of his
Will. We know this, although inexplicable, to be true;&mdash;partly
from the evidence of our own Consciousness,&mdash;which
asserts that it is so, and partly from the evidence of Morality,&mdash;which
says that it must necessarily be so. Were it otherwise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
no amount of Criminality could make a Criminal responsible.
And this truth of responsibility is one which may occasion
serious reflection to us all; to some of us sad remembrances.</p>

<p>Man, considered as causal or creative mind, cannot but act
upon the world without, as well as the world within himself.
And perhaps the nearest idea we are able to form of the process
of <em>production</em>, is the <em>inter</em>-action of power and function, evoked
by a Will, (that is a Cause); and continuing operative by aid of
ordinary laws and relativities of nature.<a name="FNanchor_AR_236" id="FNanchor_AR_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR_236" class="fnanchor">[ar]</a> One man resolves
to construct a steam engine, and on steam-power he concentrates
his thought. He conceives the relation between watery
vapour and propulsion;&mdash;and by using arbitrary signs, formulates
and measures it. Then, he considers the laws and properties
of metals, fits each contrivance into place and produces
his machine. <em>Another</em> determines to commit a murder. He
wavers&mdash;debates&mdash;wills the deed, and says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i12">"I am settled, and bend up</span></div><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">Each corporal agent to this terrible feat."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Every reader of Macbeth sees displayed before his eyes the
airy dagger; the human muscle strained to clutch the shadow
first,&mdash;afterwards, the reality;&mdash;the time, place, circumstances,
all combined, followed up&mdash;worked out, till the murderous
man has chained all conditions of success to his behest;&mdash;fulfilled
his slowly-matured purpose,&mdash;and become, as in Will,
so in act, a murderer. A <em>third</em> human being endeavours to
invent a method for teaching the deaf and dumb;&mdash;spends
a life in labouring among his silent tomb-like pupils, and
succeeds to his joy and their inestimable benefit at last. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
awakens powers lost in the shadow of death, and incites them
to the performance of those true and appropriate functions,
from which they had been incapacitated by a dwarfed and
thwarted development. Before he aroused them, all such
powers were only possibilities, visible to his hopeful eye. Now,
they are utilized and happy activities; and, like impulses
down a long electric chain, perpetuate themselves for generations
after the benevolent inventor is taken from the race he
had loved and educated.</p>

<p>There are <em>two</em> features in which all these productive men
resemble each other. <em>One</em>, the creative influence of a purely
human will, which not only sees what is not as though it is,&mdash;but
also determines that it shall be. The <em>other</em>, a way of
looking at, or rather, through Nature, as something more than
an assemblage of facts or phenomena;&mdash;of penetrating to the
<em>mind</em> of Nature,&mdash;her ideal laws legible by the intellectual
eye of Man;&mdash;and finally, of putting each required law into
motion,&mdash;that is to say, converting an idea into a force, by
the movement of the producer's Will.</p>

<p>And the same is true of every useful producer, from the
man who grows corn and wine, to the politician by whose
foresight is arranged a treaty which gives Europe the blessing
of half a century's peace. There is, probably, no example of
production more definite than the work of a real statesman.
A gifted human mind determines to pursue the thing that is
just and right and good; sees where the means to be utilized
may be found and enforced; touches the right spring of activity
and power, and leads his fellow-men into a path of precedent
or constitution for which ages may consecrate his memory.&mdash;But,
let us suppose that he or any other true producer falls
short of realizing his idea. Then, the act of Will would be in
its <em>essence</em> as noble a reality as the deed itself. Yet the work
intended,&mdash;the <em>production</em> must needs be lost. Creative will,
as an efficient cause, would have moved within the moral
sphere; but beyond, and into the outside world of men and
things, its activity must have failed to penetrate.</p>

<p>When the case comes before us in this manner and is fairly
weighed, we see that the man who wills a good choice, reflects
to his fellows the image we are accustomed to call Divine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
And that the man who produces a good act reflects to his
fellows the further likeness and idea of a Creator. The will
of man reflects a supreme will, when it refuses the evil and
chooses the good;&mdash;the creative energy of man reflects a
supreme energy, when it produces actual good; working and
remaining effectual in the world. These human reflections
may be feeble shadows, and far away from the Supreme;&mdash;as
distant as earth and stars asunder, but they are typical images
nevertheless. Man, in whom the Theist finds the impress of
God, is by his power of Causality, as far raised beyond the
laws of material existence, as animal life and movement are
superior to the clods of soil on which the living creature walks,
with a consciousness of being exalted above what he treads
upon.</p>

<p>If these far away reflections, so striking to a Theist, are, by
an unbeliever, pronounced insufficient proofs of Theism,&mdash;they
remain still of very great value to the argument&mdash;Who shall,
in the teeth of them, assert a reign of law in opposition to a
reign of Causation, when we perceive that Causality is the
grand endowment underlying the highest intelligence in this
world, and distinguishing man from every inferior creature?
A large class of objections dies in the fact that there is <em>known</em>
to us a power which can truly <em>originate</em> actions;&mdash;a clear
spring of volitional creativeness. And, as we have already
seen, it is this human power which endows us with the faculty
of self-education, and, at the same time, lays upon us the
burden of responsibility. It exempts Man from what would
otherwise be an iron chain of antecedents and consequents,
linked together by mere mechanical laws. Man, we are sure,
may interpolate in this chain; he may commence a new
series within and over-riding it. The non-Theist would (if
consistent), describe such an act of will as a miracle. Nevertheless,
it is true to every-day life, and each guilty person,
justly condemned, is a living example of this truth.</p>

<p>Any reader who has been deterred from admitting the arguments
for Theism by the strength of objections apparently
unanswerable, may feel, if he will thoughtfully reperuse this
chapter, that many very formidable difficulties have melted
away. He may also be inclined to admit that, if <em>facts</em> are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
be considered the best grounds for reasoning with probability
from the known to the unknown, the facts of nature, (including
human nature,) make not against, but for, the conclusions of
Natural Theology. And they do so all the more stringently,
because they coincide with the higher and more spiritual
tendencies of Man's being,&mdash;with the beliefs and aspirations
of the most nobly endowed among his race.</p>

<p>Many readers will go further than this. They will perceive
in the constitution of our distinctive nature, and more particularly
in the movement of Volition, a really probable though
far away similitude with the producing Cause of all things.
At all events they will say that no other similitude or illustration
has ever been conceived with so much probability. To
such minds the argument would appear sufficiently convincing
if shaped as a very wide application of the analogous reasoning
stated in our Chapter on Design. The limitations there laid
down should in this case be carefully observed; above all as
regards the <em>pivot</em> on which such an argument must turn.</p>

<p>A larger class of readers may prefer to leave the field of
this inviting analogy untouched; and remain content with
having noted its resources in passing. They will thus prefer
to pursue the more direct line of thought already adopted,
especially since it has the merit of avoiding even the most
shadowy apparent assumption of the principle invidiously
termed Anthropomorphism. We therefore continue to place
Man's causative nature side by side with external Force, and
to set the powers he exercises as an inventor, artist, and producer,
over against those natural powers we see elicited and
brought to light by his activities. This is the aspect of the
world to which the Relativity between Power and Function
most obviously conducts us. Surveyed from this aspect it
becomes plain that Nature is not entirely a soulless mechanism;&mdash;but
that the Mind of Man finds something which corresponds
to his human Thought, and which answers the touch
of his idealizing impulse by implicitly obeying it. He is able,
in this manner, to distinguish Nature's Mind from Nature's
raw material.</p>

<p>Most of us are so accustomed to look at the world <i lang="la">ab extrâ</i>,
and place ourselves in antithetical opposition to it, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
experience a kind of embarrassment in changing our point of
view, and considering how much Nature and human nature
correspond and harmonize together. There is something strange
to many persons, in the thought that <em>law</em> is an <em>idea</em> put into
operation;<a name="FNanchor_AS_237" id="FNanchor_AS_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_AS_237" class="fnanchor">[as]</a> that, when we speak of the dynamic agencies
and living forces of nature, the dynamism is derived from
<em>intelligence</em>; the life springs from mind. This is one of the
puzzles and perplexities which hang a veil between God, who
is pure Reason, and this outside world. No doubt there is
much that appears dark and enigmatic in every attempted
explanation of the subject. Yet it is clear that, whatever our
conception of matter and mind may be, one of these two must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
be resolvably consequent upon the other; and the efforts of
physicists have been strained for many years to diminish the
distance between them. With these efforts, however, we have
nothing to do beyond very distinctly adducing them<a name="FNanchor_AT_238" id="FNanchor_AT_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_AT_238" class="fnanchor">[at]</a> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
order to shew where this particular difficulty really lies, and
that it is by no means a special question of Natural Theology.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
The point for us, is rather to see how much we can discern
respecting the action of Mind <em>in</em> and <em>upon</em> Nature. To see,
that is, how many facts the realities of Production teach us.
And throughout the whole realm of Productiveness (commencing
from the steam-engine and ending with human self-formation),
there is a certain sameness of procedure and of
principle transparently discernible. And this truth, fairly
examined, yields more than one kind of argument for Theism.</p>

<p>At the first blush of the subject, it is evident that the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>scientific producer when he <em>begins</em> to move, starts from the
Causal power of mind. He moves <em>through</em> ideas or impulses
of which he is internally conscious, and which present to him
a chosen aim to be realized, a goal to be attained. It is
equally evident that, when his aim is to make or effect something
external to himself, he <em>next</em> proceeds to discover or
accept one or more principles, existing <em>for Mind alone</em>,<a name="FNanchor_193_239" id="FNanchor_193_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_239" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> but
operative in Nature. Such principles yield to his reason the
requisite proportionate relation of <em>Power</em> employed, to <em>Function</em>
designed. Upon this intelligent perception of intelligible
laws, he acts;&mdash;it works well, and succeeds;&mdash;and from this
experience of working and success, he finds for his productive
<em>intelligence</em> a daily and hourly <em>verification</em>.</p>

<p>It is well to place this subject in various lights before
reasoning upon it. We may illustrate the relativities or laws,
through which Intelligence acts, by saying that they are to
the fabric of the world, what the motory nervous system is to
a highly-developed living organism. And, putting aside for
a moment the intellectual agency of man, and applying our
similitude to illustrate natural production alone, we may say
that, just as the <em>mandatory nerves</em> imply some <em>volitional</em>
centre, so these <em>intelligent laws</em> presuppose a <em>mind in Nature</em>.
And we may not only make this clearer, but also evidence it
more certainly, by pointing to the fact that amidst Nature's
almost infinite manifoldness, we see everywhere harmony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
symmetry, order. Forces, like lines of light, traverse the
world, illuminating, (so to speak), the moving scenes of its
magnificent transparency. And the one electric lamp that
sends forth those illuminating rays, typifies the Unity from
which emanate all cosmical Forces, and which shines visibly
through them all.<a name="FNanchor_AU_240" id="FNanchor_AU_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU_240" class="fnanchor">[au]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>
<p>There is nothing imaginative or metaphysical involved in
this statement. It amounts to no more than what many very
eminent physicists lay down, as implicitly contained in their
sciences. On <em>this very</em> ground, Professor Baden Powell holds
the validity of the argument from Design, as was mentioned in
a former chapter. He puts the case into a few words thus:&mdash;"In
the present state of knowledge, law and order, physical
causation and uniformity of action, are the elevated manifestations
of Divinity, creation and providence."<a name="FNanchor_194_241" id="FNanchor_194_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_241" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> A few passages
further on, he repudiates with scorn the vulgar supposition
that physical science can be confined to the circle of outward
experience alone;<a name="FNanchor_195_242" id="FNanchor_195_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_242" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> it includes within itself the principle of
directing intelligence. According to Comte himself, "un fait
s'explique par un fait d'un ordre supérieur, dont la perfection
est sa raison, dont l'action qu'elle renferme est sa cause."<a name="FNanchor_196_243" id="FNanchor_196_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_243" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>It does indeed seem as impossible to deny the existence and
operation of <em>Mind</em> in Nature, as it is to deny the existence and
consciousness of our own minds. No tenable reason can ever
be assigned why, when we look forth into the world surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>ing
us, we should be able to ascertain the fact of corporeal
existence by means of our bodily senses, and be, at the same
time, unable to ascertain the fact of existing intelligence by
means of our mental intuitions. Each kind of existence has
its appropriate evidence, and <em>both</em> sorts of evidence claim our
belief by appealing to the veracity of our human consciousness.</p>

<p>If, therefore, it were possible to say with certitude "There is
no God," the certainty would not, because it <em>could</em> not, eliminate
Mind from the Universe. The law of production exists
in, and for the Mind,&mdash;and so far as we can know, Mind in
some shape or other works through the intelligible law.<a name="FNanchor_AV_244" id="FNanchor_AV_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_AV_244" class="fnanchor">[av]</a>
Suppose we frame a crucial case for investigation.</p>

<p>Without speculating upon the first origin of things natural&mdash;without
taking into the inquiry any preconception of a
Divine personality&mdash;let us inquire what the world of Nature
as it now exists can teach any man respecting the <em>kind</em>,
<em>degree</em>, or <em>condition</em> of Mind, which regulates and moulds it?
We are obliged to say "moulds it";&mdash;for Nature is not presented
to us as an inert mass. We see movement, change,
and activity everywhere. And this fact makes a vast difference
to the present question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us, then, suppose the inquirer setting out from an attempt
to conceive mind as immersed in matter; either being <em>identical</em>
with it,<a name="FNanchor_AW_245" id="FNanchor_AW_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_245" class="fnanchor">[aw]</a> or <em>pervading</em> it, like a subtle fluid, or imponderable
force. Let some such conception be supposed his starting
point. What sort of a Power must he finally determine this
mind to be?</p>

<p>Could he possibly commence with a mundane intelligence
inferior to the mind of Man?&mdash;The bee can build a cell, the
beaver a dam&mdash;but the bee cannot construct a dam, nor the
beaver a cell. The same is true universally. Animal intelligence
acts in single right lines. We should, therefore, be
obliged to conceive as <em>many minds</em> immanent in nature, or as
many modifications of mind, as there are varieties of production.
And if this were true, what would become of the order
and harmony of the Universe? We call it by that name,
because we know that, (notwithstanding its marvellous diversity
and manifoldness,) it forms a grand united whole. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
would become necessary, <em>next</em>, to admit a governing intelligence,
able to control the countless species of intelligent power
employed in producing all sorts of effects. And it really seems
easier, at once to conceive a supreme Mind, framing its ideas
into intelligible laws, and launching the forces of the Universe
in moving might along them.</p>

<p>There are many obvious reasons why, after all, this would
be the easiest,<a name="FNanchor_197_246" id="FNanchor_197_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_246" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and <em>therefore</em> the preferable, conception. <em>One</em>
lies in the immeasurable width and extent of that relativity
between power and function, which we have seen to underlie
every known production,&mdash;and conceivable <em>possibility</em> of ruling
or moulding Nature. Now, under <em>power</em> we class forces such
as those which hold corpuscles in cohesion, balance the orbs of
heaven, or control the growth of a crystal. Such as those,
again, which make Life the counterbalance of dissolution and
decay; and enable the animal frame to resist decomposing
influences; to feed, to grow, to energize, and move freely on
earth, in water, or in air. Such as those, finally, which yield
us the <i>pabulum</i> of sensation, thought, emotion; and subserve
our efforts to attain whatever is highest or noblest in our
human world.</p>

<p>We know what sorts of intelligence are required to apprehend,
and to do no more than apprehend, the rationale of many
among these natural movements, forces, and processes. Some
of them can be explained only by a very great mathematician,
other some by an equally great chemist, biologist, or psychologist.
And in some, Man of the 19th century is as much a
<i>tyro</i> and disciple,&mdash;as ignorant and as tentative&mdash;as his forefathers
were two thousand years ago. What a complexity of
Minds, or what a majestic supremacy of one Mind becomes
thus discernible by the eye of Reason! Of Reason we say,
meaning thereby the reason of a human being who looks facts
in the face, puts them together and draws the inevitable conclusion.
Were this drawn, it would amount to something
very like a re-affirmation of Theism. At present, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
we will not press these topics further; since our object is to
put an opposite conception on its complete trial, so as to see
what is eventually implied in it.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, a merely sensitive intelligence to
represent the character of mind administering the Universe.
Conceive, if you choose, the world to be like an animal as
some old philosophies conceived it. The way in which a
<em>human</em> being sees Power and Function is altogether different
from the way in which they would be viewed by the supposed
mundane intelligence. <em>We</em> do not see them as two entities
<em>separately</em> existing, and the relation which is of such vital
consequence to all inventors and producers, as <em>something</em> which
ensues between them. To us, the causal essence of the Power
lies in the <em>relativity</em> itself, and we often actually recognize
the Power passing over into its Function, and becoming lost
in it. An example in point, lies in the active combination of
uncombined atoms and molecules;&mdash;the <em>relativity</em> (or, as in
such a case it is termed, the <em>attraction</em>) is the immediate
cause of the production. "Thus" says Dr. Tyndall<a name="FNanchor_198_247" id="FNanchor_198_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_247" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> "we can
get power out of oxygen and hydrogen by the act of their
union, but once they are combined, and once the motion consequent
on their combination has been expended, no further
power can be got out of the mutual attraction of oxygen and
hydrogen. As dynamic agents they are dead." We can, in
this manner, produce from the combustion of coal, light, heat,
and propulsive force; but coal and oxygen are <em>consumed</em> in
the producing process. Yet in this process, <em>what and how
much</em> would have come within the grasp of a merely sensitive
intelligence? Simply the object coal,&mdash;the brilliant light,&mdash;the
pleasant heat,&mdash;and the actual movement of an incomprehensible
machine. Let Mundane Mind be thus conceived and
Nature would necessarily be administered by an intelligence
which never got below the surface. The result, as we may
certainly perceive, must have always lain between either an
unchanging sameness, or the instability of chance misdirection.
A state of things which compared with our actual world would
seem most unsatisfactory; but which never has in fact been
realized, for a reason at once apparent to the reader's sagacity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>
<p>Take another instance of change. The chemical elements
of a Galvanic battery disappear in performing their function
of causing a current, and the current may in turn disappear
in the decomposition of water. But what merely sensitive
intelligence could discern the invisible agency,&mdash;or measure
the conversion of force, where nothing is visible except loss?
Besides, in this latter example do we not see how truly correlative
these two terms Power and Function are? We may
intelligently think and speak of the chemical constituents of
the battery, as conjoint <em>Power</em>;&mdash;and of their accomplishing
their <em>Function</em> in the Current. But we may also speak of
the <em>current</em> as a Power, accomplishing <em>its</em> Function by evolving
from water two elementary gases. In other words, the ideas
of Power and Function, definite enough to the eye of reason,
are in all other respects, <em>fluent</em>. They are neither things, nor
phenomenal attributes of things. They <em>are</em> power and function
by virtue of a relation existing between them, and this relation
is a fact not of the bare impressible sense, but of our purely
reasoning intellect.</p>

<p>The same consequence appears, (in a shape which to some
minds may be easier,) from viewing in another light the very
same example of a galvanic battery, applied to decompose
water. At each end of the chain there are palpable materials,
visible to corporeal sense. But, between them runs the true
force;&mdash;and this is absolutely impalpable. We theorize upon
this force, but, whatever our theories may be, we accept its
reality as a fact clear to our human <em>mind</em>. And we also
clearly see that no lower mind could possibly apprehend it.</p>

<p>And here arises a curious question well worth a brief consideration.
It is this:&mdash;To any kind of mind, the faculties of
which are bound up in sense, <em>what</em> would appear to be the
realities, and <em>what</em> the unrealities of the Universe? Galvanic
wires or chains are perceptible to our bodily senses, but the
traversing force is imperceptible. Hence, in our common
speech, we are easily led to talk of the polar elements or
objects (whatever they are) as realities <i>par excellence</i>;&mdash;but
without in the least meaning to imply that the <em>nexus</em> or relativity
between them is any less real; or less a fact. What we
do mean, is, that this reality is a fact to another, and a finer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
faculty. But what would it be if the finer faculty were
wanting?&mdash;Reality would in that case become phenomenal;&mdash;and
phenomena (according to Dr. Whewell and other inductive
philosophers), would at the same time cease to be
facts.</p>

<p>So far, therefore, as we know,&mdash;and we still limit this discussion
to what we really do know,&mdash;were Reason wanting,
all the nobler part of the Universe&mdash;its highest realities,&mdash;as
understood by us, could not be held real. They would
fade like an insubstantial pageant&mdash;or the baseless fabric of
a dream. For, be it repeated,&mdash;<em>we</em> do not see as a merely
sensitive mind must see. Principles and laws, sustaining and
administering the universal mechanism, are the visible realities
of intellect; and are visible to intellect alone. Thus, no one
ever saw the principle of the arch except by an act of intellectual
sight, and yet in the strength of it all arches stand
firm. So, too, an architect knows that the stability and
beauty of his structure depend on much that is hidden from
the uninstructed human eye. What meaner eye, then, could
ever succeed in piercing the secret architecture of the Universe?
To the mundane mind, if less than human, the most real would
become unreal,&mdash;and the shadow appear to be the substance.
No supposition can possibly seem more absurd! Yet, when
people speak of a "blind intelligence" in Nature, they must
mean something less than Reason by that strange contradictory
appellation.</p>

<p>The case for Unreason can never be improved by saying
that 'The world, as it exists, is a system of accordant forces;
tending to fulfil their functions through a kind of self-evolving
movement, excited and controlled by correlation and correspondence,
action and interaction. The products prevail, where
they do prevail, through the completeness of their harmony
with their surroundings. By virtue of this acquired excellence
which becomes intrinsic, each finally develops itself into a
permanent and integrated unit.' Here, obviously, the question
of Intelligence recurs. If Mind were a necessary postulate
before, how much more stringent the necessity now! From
hosts of uncounted relativities we infer an Absolute;&mdash;surveying
their rhythmical stir and onward strivings what shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
we predicate respecting it? The world might have been a
discord;&mdash;Whence came its first symphonious movement?&mdash;its
after-waves of sphere-music majestically sweet to understanding
ears;&mdash;its deeper and still deeper accordances;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"The Diapason ending full in Man,"</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>that is to say, thus ending so far as the solemn march has
been played out! What shall be hereafter, we know not now.
But most marvellous of all as yet, is that first chord which
struck the key-note of the whole harmonious performance.<a name="FNanchor_199_248" id="FNanchor_199_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_248" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the answers to these inquiries, must have
the effect of infinitely elevating our own idea of the intelligence
discoverable in natural productions;&mdash;because they will add
to our perception of its wonderful insight, a still more wonderful
impression of <em>fore</em>sight,&mdash;a foresight extending over
illimitable periods of time; and causing effects, for the calculation
of which no power of intellect actually known to us,
would have any adequate sufficiency.</p>

<p>The only apparent evasion of this consequence, is to deny
arrangement altogether. But, then, how great are the resulting
difficulties! In the <em>first</em> place, it would seem at once to restore
covertly, if not openly, that very ancient Divine principle,
Chance; whose banishment has long been agreed upon by
reflective men. In the <em>next</em> place, it is not clear how, looking
at the scientific doctrine of Chances,<a name="FNanchor_AX_249" id="FNanchor_AX_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_AX_249" class="fnanchor">[ax]</a> they would, when
calculated, yield any probability whatever of production;&mdash;or
even (what appears a less thing), of development from a rudimentary
or less perfect structure already existing. The consequence
is, that one or more principles besides Chance must
soon be postulated, and "blind laws" are held insufficient
because not unlikely to become guilty of incidental misdirection.
This need of auxiliary postulates has determined some
very staunch advocates of Evolution to maintain that the circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
of evolving laws or forces must certainly be ruled by some Intelligence,
either inherent and immanent (mind and movement
identical),&mdash;or else separate, transcendental, and probably personal,
superintending and superior to them all.<a name="FNanchor_AY_250" id="FNanchor_AY_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_AY_250" class="fnanchor">[ay]</a></p>

<p>Indeed the affirmation of Mind in Nature as a positively
perceived Fact appears to be the sure direction of our human
understanding, if allowed to observe and judge in a common-sense
way. And the reason of the thing is obvious. Whenever
we perceive anything by bodily vision and touch, or
other material instruments, we unhesitatingly attribute to it a
material existence. We derive our impression from a material
antecedent, and say <em>here</em> is a corporeal substance,&mdash;in a word,&mdash;body.
So, on the other hand, whenever material instruments
are dispensed with, (because inadequate and unsuitable),
and when Mind alone is used as our medium of perception,
we are quite sure that what we perceive is not Body but Mind.
In this manner, we know what to say of arrangement, counterbalance,
superior excellence, (which means superior fitness),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
tendency to a function, (that is fitness in movement), or of a
system of relation and correlation transcending the highest
flight of human imagination. We say at once, <em>here</em> is Mind.
We do not think it necessary to employ a periphrasis, and
reason on the properties of intelligence, any more than we
should, when receiving information from our senses, commence
a syllogism on the properties of Matter. We simply say in
the two several cases,&mdash;here is body,&mdash;here is mind. And, as
regards both propositions, we are in all likelihood equally
safe in saying so.</p>

<p>The real question, therefore, remains just as we before stated
it. We then derived our statement from the process of production,&mdash;first
by analyzing it, and next, by shewing that the
analysis was verified in experience. We have since run some
risk of repetition, in order to look at the whole subject of Mind
in Nature from various points of view. The effect has been to
confirm for us, the issue above raised as being the right and
true question. We must not ask, "Is there Mind in the
natural world?" but "What <em>kind</em> and <em>degree</em> of Intelligence
do we, from our observation of facts, attribute to the Mind
evidenced in the Universe?"</p>

<p>It is in answering this question that the <em>fitnesses</em> of organized
structures yield so many important considerations. We
are not however obliged to follow the chain of the Design
argument, liken these structures to objects of human art, and
say, here is Design implying a Designer. We may quite as
easily look at them in the light of the great productive Law
we have been investigating. Fitness consists in the nicety of
the manner in which Function is correlated with Power.
Throughout the realm of organisms, vegetable and animal,
the most beautiful examples of such correlation meet us at
every turn.<a name="FNanchor_AZ_251" id="FNanchor_AZ_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_AZ_251" class="fnanchor">[az]</a> When therefore we put our query, what
character may here be ascribed to the Mundane Intelligence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
the reply cannot seem doubtful. Instances of pre-eminent
Fitness (such as those adduced further on) need not be understood
in any other sense than this, in order to accomplish the
purpose for which they are described. Neither need such
words as adaptation or design, used for brevity's sake, be taken
as references to the analogical argument discussed in our
second Chapter. Mr. Darwin himself has frequently employed
the expressions "contrivance," "purpose," etc., without intending
any such reference,&mdash;nay, rather with the full intention
of arguing for a different account of the "contrivances" he
specifies.</p>

<p>From such wonderful examples of Fitness, many minds will
choose at once to read the broad lesson of Teleology. Be it
observed then that if this is done, the larger the generality
under which the principle of Design is conceived, the better
for its force in reasoning. As an argument, the idea has
suffered from the imagination of readers dwelling upon the
specialities recounted in many valuable books to the exclusion
of wider and more universal conceptions. There is a vast
difference,<a name="FNanchor_BA_252" id="FNanchor_BA_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA_252" class="fnanchor">[ba]</a> between the assertion of a grand Unity, (in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
subservience to which all other things have their several determinate
purposes,) and the being able to say in <em>each</em> smaller
instance, here is <em>the</em> design or intended relation between this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
individual structure or condition, and this sole and definite
finality. A good specimen of the difficulty thus occasioned,
is an objection of Littré's against the idea of Divinely beneficent
adaptation. Why, he asks, should the bite of a mad
dog have been allowed to produce hydrophobia? Why, that is,
should the dog's saliva have been so <em>contrived</em>, as to convey so
virulent a blood poison? The true answer, of course, must be
that this effect is but <em>one</em> operation of a much more extensive
physiological law;&mdash;a law producing results, often of the most
beneficial character. We must also, (as the same writer
allows), draw a strong distinction between every law, and
what is technically termed its "functioning."<a name="FNanchor_200_253" id="FNanchor_200_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_253" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Littré views
Nature as a moving panorama of antecedents and
consequents;&mdash;but he is obliged to confess that the <em>nexus</em> is <em>not</em>
invariable. There are, indeed, variations, for which he
employs this same "functioning," as a kind of apology. The
necessity of such an apology is in itself a remarkable fact;
since it shews how little rigorous is the common argument
used by many physicists against the probability of Miracles.
The necessity of natural sequence is, after all, no adamantine
fatality; and therefore Testimony to an event contrary to our
experience and expectation, may have a most decisive value.<a name="FNanchor_201_254" id="FNanchor_201_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_254" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>We have already shewn that to see a law in Nature, is to
see an actual instance of <em>wide</em> intelligence. Now, so seen, it is
known as existing <i lang="la">in rerum naturâ</i>&mdash;active&mdash;energizing&mdash;productive.
But, suppose we for a moment conceive the
intelligible law, as existing only in the intelligence itself,&mdash;a
thought prior to its realization. The law is <em>then</em> what
writers on natural history often call a <em>type</em>;&mdash;or, as it is
termed in the older philosophical language, an <em>idea</em>. The
readers of S. T. Coleridge will not easily forget his chapter
reconciling the Platonic and Baconian<a name="FNanchor_BB_255" id="FNanchor_BB_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB_255" class="fnanchor">[bb]</a> methods of Philo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>sophy.
It turns, in great part, upon the essential identity
of <em>idea</em> with <em>law</em>. (<cite>Friend</cite>, Vol. III. Essay ix.)</p>

<p>If, therefore, we perceive in anything creative, or any <em>system</em>
whatsoever, a harmony of power with function, we call it
fitness, or even adaptation when describing the actual matter
of our own <em>observations</em>. But, if we speak of the same harmony
<em>as an act of mind</em>, we call it intelligent adaptation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
And, this at least, is what careful writers on Natural Theology
mean by the word Design. Yet, certain careless objectors have
misconceived the plain meaning, so far as to assert that if we
would speak of any production as designed, it must first be
proved not only intentional but <em>arbitrary</em>. This misconception&mdash;(the
very opposite of our meaning)&mdash;seems to turn upon the
mixture of two distinct notions,&mdash;the design of <em>reason</em> and the
determination of <em>caprice</em>. If Natural Theologians wished to
prove that the Designer of the Universe was always doing
wrong,&mdash;and was always right <em>because</em> he did wrong,&mdash;it would
be necessary to argue that design and caprice are one and the
same thing. But Natural Theology endeavours to shew the
exact contradictory. Its idea is, above all things, the Idea of
a Sovereign Reason manifest in universal Law.</p>

<p>The rejoinder has been made that at all events a Will is
implied in Design;&mdash;and that he who wills acts arbitrarily.
Of course, there is a certain sense in which this may be true.
A Sovereign will <em>could</em> at pleasure refuse the Right and choose
the Wrong, but then it would cease to be a Sovereign Reason.
That is, it would cease to be Sovereign at all, in any true Theology.
And we may, likewise, add that the ordinary instances
and illustrations of Design never aim at proving Will <em>directly</em>;&mdash;their
immediate object is to shew Intelligence, foreseeing
ends or functions, and purposing their attainment. It is clear
that Will must <em>indirectly</em> be implied in such an argument.
But, then, it is so implied, partly because all Reason is <i>per se</i>
identical with Will, and partly because (as we shall endeavour
to shew), Causation necessarily emanates from Will. The
reader must, however, assign each conclusion to its proper
argument, and keep each argument to its proper conclusion;&mdash;a
rule which those who dispute for victory, and not for truth,
frequently fail to observe.</p>

<p>The use we are now making of fitness and adaptation is less
to prove the existence of Mind in the Universe, than its grandeur,
grasp, and comprehensiveness. For this purpose our
clearest evidence arises from the <em>coincidence</em> of several <em>diverse</em>
conditions, tending to one sovereign finality of function. And
indeed, this argument from coincidence, is generally the most
convincing;&mdash;the greater the <em>convergence</em> of separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
conditions,&mdash;the stronger is our assurance that Mind determined the
result.<a name="FNanchor_BC_256" id="FNanchor_BC_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_BC_256" class="fnanchor">[bc]</a> Our sense of sight has always been a favourite
subject in Natural Theology. It is familiar, and, so far as a
broad outline of the function is concerned, may be easily
studied by any common-sense person. It is, also, evidently
<em>one</em> Function; yet, even cursory observation shews a great
diversity of powers contributing to produce it. How diverse
they are, may be perceived by supposing first one and then
another element of eyesight to be absent, and considering what
the effect of <em>each</em> deficiency must be.</p>

<p>Suppose, there were no light. The eye then, however beautiful
and perfect in structure, would not be a means serving
any purpose of perception. It is clear thus that the eye is an
optical instrument.</p>

<p>Suppose, again, light and optical arrangement both in existence,
but, also, that the eye had no power of <em>adjusting</em>
itself to the direction of objects and other circumstances;
evidently its function of vision would be very much restricted.</p>

<p>In relation to this end, the eye is a mechanical<a name="FNanchor_202_257" id="FNanchor_202_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_257" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> instrument.</p>

<p>We might, further, suppose the optical apparatus to work
well, its adjustment also to be perfect,&mdash;and the picture on the
retina no less so. But, with this perfect picture, suppose all
ended. The function of eyesight would be as irretrievably
gone as in our first case.</p>

<p>This shews us that the eye does <em>not</em> really see. It is the
servant of an impressible Power,&mdash;and this impressible power
uses it, and sees through it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>Suppose, finally, that the picture on the retina set vibratory
nerves in movement&mdash;each microscopic stroke producing its
effect of vibration. Let something be seen by the impressible
Power, but not apprehended as an object of <em>common</em> perception.
Let there be no comparison with other sensations; no transcript
into sense-language, of what is at once seen, touched,
heard, smelled, or tasted. Consider, how barren and unproductive
the result! Eyesight is reduced to a play of coloured
images. There can be no malleable material for Intelligence
to work up. Nothing to be cast into any universal mould;&mdash;no
possibility of a greedy Mind feeding eagerly through the
quick perceiving eye.</p>

<p>In the absence of information given, or thought stimulated,
we must pronounce such sight unintelligent;&mdash;and the Eye
an unintelligible phenomenon. But why? The anatomical
structure remains perfect. It is the <em>adaptation</em> that has been
lost along with the finality, and this loss is fatal. Hence the
paramount importance of finality.</p>

<p>Any student may pursue this ruling idea of "<em>adaptation to a
functional end</em>," through a vast range of the Animal kingdom.
There are eyes fitted to long distances&mdash;almost telescopic;&mdash;eyes
so contrived as to be absolutely microscopical. Then, as
the refraction of water differs from that of air, the optical lenses
of fishes become rounded almost like little balls. And, the
observer who passes into the tribes of Invertebrata, will
acquaint himself with eyes mounted upon footstalks,<a name="FNanchor_203_258" id="FNanchor_203_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_258" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and
eyes multiplied and placed in different situations. Few
natural objects are more wonderful than the contrivance of a
compound eye. The many hexagonal tubes, which may be
reckoned by the thousand, are cemented together on one
expanded and swollen nervous disk, reminding us of the
thalamus in the great plant order of Compositæ, (Syngenesia),&mdash;in
the Elecampagne for instance, the Bur Marigold, Thistle,
and Centaurea. A compound eye has a range of vision extending
over about 180 degrees, (half a circle), and must from its
structure be endowed with specializing distinctness. Mind in
the Universe, is thus presented to us, as in the New Testament,&mdash;wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
as the whole arch of heaven, but cognizant of a sparrow
or a lily.</p>

<p>A creature with diminished vision&mdash;such as the Mole&mdash;or
the Amblyopsis, is a curiously interesting study in itself;&mdash;still
more so as an example of adaptation.</p>

<p>In old times, the Mole was accounted blind. Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_204_259" id="FNanchor_204_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_259" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
observed that a structural eye exists, but that a skin is drawn
over it, and this skin deprives the animal of sight. His
observation has made work for commentators, from Simplicius
downwards. Trendelenburg (on the <cite>De Anima</cite>) confines himself
to criticism. Torstrik makes a kind of apology for not
excising "<i lang="la">quæ loco</i> <i lang="el">ἀτοπωτάτῳ</i> <i lang="la">de talpâ dicuntur</i>." Cardinal
Tolet accepts the observation, and thinks the Mole's eyes thus
admirably protected from the bad effects of a sudden access
of light, when he rushes violently into appearance overground.
Naturalists during many centuries, made the whole history of
the mole a piece of guesswork, and no creature except the
Sloth or the Earwig has ever been more generally misrepresented.
Perhaps our familiar old English "Moldwarp" (West
of England "Want"), might have remained a puzzle to this
day had not a French courtier<a name="FNanchor_205_260" id="FNanchor_205_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_260" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> fled from the Paris Revolution,
and devoted his attention to Moles. The fact that the eye of
our Western Mole is not completely closed, may be proved by
throwing a living specimen into a pond. But, in the South
and East of Europe the "blind mole" does really exist,<a name="FNanchor_206_261" id="FNanchor_206_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_261" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> as
has been shown by Erhard and the Prince of Musignano. In
more than one species, the skin passes over the eyeball
without any loss of hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>This diminution of eyesight is a case of what has been
called "retrogression." Now the Mole is a highly developed
Mammal, and his position in the animal kingdom entitles him
to the best of eyes. But, they would not suit his habits. The
same is true of the Blind-fish of Kentucky (Amblyopsis Spelæus).
For such a creature, not the distinct vision of objects,&mdash;but
a sensation of light,&mdash;was the <em>desirable</em> possession,&mdash;and
the creature has it.<a name="FNanchor_207_262" id="FNanchor_207_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_262" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>It does not in the least matter, as a question of Fitness,
whether this retrograde condition of the eye was brought
about by natural laws slowly acting upon the animal frame,
or produced in some more rapid way. The fitness is the
same; and, as we are at present engaged, not on proving the
existence of Mind, but in illustrating the greatness of a
confessedly existing mind, these instances of far reaching
adaptation are very strongly in point.</p>

<p>Of the cavernous life and habits of the Amblyopsis there is
not much to be said; though the idea of a happy existence
amidst depths of sepulchral gloom, naturally excites our imagination.
But "the little gentleman in black" whose health used
to be enthusiastically drunk a century and a half ago, is a
perfect study<a name="FNanchor_208_263" id="FNanchor_208_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_263" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> in himself. We are interested by his fairy-like
gift of hearing (noted by Shakespeare); his gluttony; his
fleetness of foot; his combativeness; and his castle-building!
As a civil and military engineer, he far surpasses the beaver,
though dwelling in dark places, and with only a dubious pair
of eyes in his scheming quick-conceiving head.</p>

<p>Probably, the sense <em>we</em> should all least wish to lose is our
eyesight. Its perpetual delight, and its capacity for improvement
by training are powerful motives for treasuring its
possession. The savage and the microscopist, the artist and
the astronomer, all train their faculty of vision; and how
differently do these four classes of eyes see!&mdash;The difference is,
we know, in exact proportion to the intelligence which employs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
and educates them. And, conversely, how the nobly-governed
eye informs and educates the Mind! What a world of hope,
then, as well as beauty, seems to die when we conceive the
blind man in his dim solitude! Yet the contentment of its
sightless inmates, is one of the most salient comforts of every
blind asylum. Most likely, their cheerfulness depends on the
great use of finger-dexterity, and the exquisite susceptibility
of the ear. And these delicate endowments, which make our
several senses inlets of happiness, are amongst the most fascinating
illustrations of the Universal Mind with which we
have to do.</p>

<p>The structure of the ear is far less commonly dwelt upon by
most writers, than the structure of the eye. Indeed, its organization
seems to less certainty explained, the problem being,
of course, to trace the transmission of sound to the auditory
nerve. But, as in ancient Egypt, so in modern England, the
treatment of disease in special organs has been divided amongst
special therapeutists; and the ear does not fail to benefit by
being better understood. There is, even now, room for hypothesis
in some parts of the process of sonorous transmission,&mdash;and
beyond that process, science does not pretend to go.
Modern views, however, as Dr. Tyndall truly says, "present
the phenomena in a connected and intelligible form, and should
they be doomed to displacement by a more correct or comprehensive
theory, it will assuredly be found that the wonder is
not diminished by the substitution of the truth." No one has
put the wonder into a more intelligible shape than this well
known writer, at the close of his book upon Sound.<a name="FNanchor_209_264" id="FNanchor_209_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_264" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>
<p>Employing instances of Design for the purpose, to us most
relevant, and gleaning a few among hosts of shining illustrations,
there is nothing more alluring than the spectacle of the
organic world, considered as a source, not of life only, nor of
information only, but of emotional pleasure and never failing
enjoyment. No kind of existence can be more depressing to
our highly-strung human nervous-system, than the shut up
occupations which overgrown cities necessitate. Yet, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
what unrepressed vigour of delight does the artizan, the physician,
the schoolmaster, or the curate of a town parish, look
upon the open world beyond! And, never has there existed
any human being more truly impressible by Nature's loveliness,
or more skilled in conveying the impression to the minds
of others, than a genuine British Naturalist. For the holiday-maker
to walk with such a lover of Nature through field and
forest, over moor and mountain, by rivulet, lake or sea, is to
gain a new sense of wonder and admiration;&mdash;new perceptions
of excellence, symmetry, and unity; while freshened emotions
of religious awe and trust keep springing upwards from them
all. It is with outward nature, as it is with individual natures;
the regard of a loving eye is the true revealer of hidden secrets.
For in reality we see, not only with our bodily sense and our
contemplative reason, but also with the strength and insight
of affection. And thus many a weary Man perpetually finds
the aspect of the visible universe indescribably soothing amidst
his own confusions and disappointments. He may feel, at
times, that his human heart can penetrate beyond what eye
and head have taught him; and, while thoughtfully observing
the footprints of creative mind, he can feel within his bosom a
sense of superhuman tenderness, like the warm breath of his
living Creator.</p>

<p>The very fact that highly-endowed and deeply thoughtful
men<a name="FNanchor_210_265" id="FNanchor_210_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_265" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> have so felt and spoken, ought not to be without its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
influence. There is much conveyed&mdash;very much indeed&mdash;by
the truth that the world is beautiful. If, when we examine
natural production, intelligent operation is seen to imply an
operative intelligence, is it not also true that realized beauty
implies an ideal beauty, intelligently preconceived in a Mind
itself beautiful? Had there been nothing in earth or sky to
soothe, elevate, and make happy, with <em>what different feelings</em>,
should we have attempted to picture productive Mind at work
through an unlovely Universe!</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL NOTE.</h3>

<h4><a id="A.5"></a>ON THE DOCTRINE OF CHANCES APPLIED TO THE
STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE EYE.</h4>


<p>The present Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford wrote, in
1867, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The chances of any accidental variation in such an instrument being
an <em>improvement</em> are small indeed. Suppose, for instance, one of the
surfaces of the crystalline lens of the eye of a creature, possessing a
crystalline and cornea, to be accidentally altered, then I say, that unless
the form of the other surface is simultaneously altered, <em>in one only way</em>
out of millions of possible ways, the eye would not be optically <em>improved</em>.
An alteration also in the two surfaces of the crystalline lens, whether
accidental or otherwise, would involve a definite alteration in the form of
the cornea, or in the distance of its surface from the centre of the
crystalline lens, in order that the eye may be optically better. All these
alterations must be simultaneous and definite in amount, and these
definite amounts must coexist in obedience to an extremely complicated
law. To my apprehension then, that so complex an instrument as an
eye should undergo a succession of millions of <em>improvements</em>, by means
of a succession of millions of <em>accidental</em> alterations, is not less improbable,
than if all the letters in the 'Origin of Species' were placed in a box,
and on being shaken and poured out millions on millions of times, they
should at last come out together in the order in which they occur in that
fascinating and, in general, highly philosophical work.</p>

<p>"But my objections do not stop here. The improvement of an organ
must be an improvement relative to the new circumstances by which the
organ is surrounded. Suppose, then, that an eye is altered for the better
in relation to one set of circumstances under which it is placed. By-and-bye
there arise a second set of circumstances, and the eye is again, by
Natural Selection, altered and improved relatively to the second set of
circumstances. What is there to make the second set of circumstances
such that the second improvement (relative to them) shall be an improvement
or progress <em>in the direction</em> of the ultimate goal of the human
eye? Why should not the second improvement be a retrogression
<em>away from</em> the ultimate organ now possessed by man, and necessary to
his well-being? But all this suiting of the succession of circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
is to go on, not once or twice, but millions on millions of times. If this
be so, then not only must there be a <span class="smcap">Bias</span> in the order of the succession
of the circumstances, or, at all events, in the vast outnumbering of the
unfavourable circumstances by the favourable, but so strong a bias, as to
remove the whole process from the accidental to the <em>intentional</em>. The
<em>bias</em> implies the existence of a Law, a Mind, a Will. The process
becomes one not of Natural Selection, but of <em>Selection by an Intelligent
Will</em>." <cite>Analogies in the Progress of Nature and Grace</cite>, (being the Hulsean
Lectures for 1867,) Appendix A, p. 125 seq. The whole article should be

<p class="center">SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTER VI.</p>



<p class="hang">The two last Chapters are intended to be read consecutively, but are
formally separated in order to mark the transition of Argument. If
this is borne in mind, and the line of thought pursued continuously,
there will appear to be little need for further elucidation.</p>

<p class="hang">The main object of the present Chapter is to distinguish the physical
chain of Sequency from Causation properly so termed. In other
words to divide the World, as we see it, into two spheres; the
Mechanical and the Personal.</p>

<p class="hang">The former is characterized by invariable Sequency. The latter by Causation,
and by causal interference with the mechanical chain of antecedent
and consequent.</p>

<p class="hang">Inferences are drawn from these contrasted facts.</p>


<p class="hang"><i>Analysis.</i>&mdash;Causation not explained by any of the empirical sciences.
Time accounts for nothing. Explicit statements of scientific men
on the subject. "Inquire elsewhere." This is one good reason for
the study of Natural Theology.</p>

<p class="hang">Only one kind of true Cause known to us by Experience. Distinction
between a true Cause and the invariable antecedent of an invariable
consequent. Antecedent enters Chain of natural sequency; Cause
does not. Cause must account for the several links of Chain, for the
connection between those links, and for the entire Chain considered
as a Whole and Unity in Nature. This position illustrated and investigated.
How grasped by the young mind. Its verification.</p>

<p class="hang">Known facts of Causation result in the Unknowable; a condition which
attaches to the most certain of all truths. Personality a case in
point. Another case that of alterations caused by Volition in chains
of Natural Sequency. Common-sense allowances made for this last
fact.</p>

<p class="hang">Application <i lang="la">à fortiori</i> to the Divine Personality. Presumption for miracles;
its nature and limits. Intervention does not destroy Order
and Unity. Hence we distinguish two possible kinds of Evidence,
from,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. General Order of World.</p>

<p>2. Occasional variation.</p>

<p>Both leading up to a Supreme causal Personality.</p>

<p  class="center"><big>CHAPTER VI</big>.</p>

<p class="center">CAUSATION.</p>


<p>This sixth Chapter occupies a totally different sphere of
Thought from the one preceding it. Instead of examining the
world as it now is, we shall inquire what its present existence
necessarily presupposes. Time, in the ordinary meaning of
the word, is no factor in our calculation. We have to deal
with Time's antecedents.</p>

<p>These words sound like a long farewell to our companion
and auxiliary,&mdash;Natural Science! Geology, Palæontology, Astronomy,
are unanimous in telling us of periods immeasurably
remote. But, they are all silent on two more distant and profound
subjects&mdash;a Beginning and an Eternity. In the world
best known to us, vast cycles&mdash;each comprehending many
ages of life&mdash;- point back to preceding cycles made up of ages
more numerous still, during which the world was absolutely
void of life. Upon that primæval fabric, are graved long
records of changes beyond the reach of Thought. A single
epoch,&mdash;the era when our globe, an incandescent mass of
matter, was cooling in its flight,&mdash;is alone sufficient to exhaust
all our imaginative powers. Did water first surround the
glowing orb as a heated vapour? Did clouds first descend upon
it like a fiery rain-storm? Suppose some sentient creature
floating through ether to look upon the unformed world,&mdash;how
wild, how weird must have been the spectacle! How
different from what earth and ocean may appear to any similar
Intelligence now.</p>

<p>Science discoursing upon such topics is more poetical than
the most sublime poetry. And the science that does speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
them is the widest of all sciences, After certain cycles of
ages, the Biologist hands us over to the Mineralogist and the
Chemist. After certain other cycles, we give up those guides
in turn; and gauge nature by measuring mass, speed, force,
comparing our own orb with kindred orbs, and trying to
collect what the comparison can say respecting the earliest
conditions of the Universe. But, all this is no answer to our
proposed question concerning Time's antecedents. "The territory
of physics" says a well-known physicist, "is wide, but it
has its limits from which we look with vacant gaze into the
region beyond."<a name="FNanchor_211_266" id="FNanchor_211_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_266" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> And these words are evidently true. Time
serves, in this respect, as the index of our incapacity. We
travel back from the period of Man to the period of a ferny
coal field, a trilobite or an Eozoon, and from thence to the period
when nebulous light-masses shone out through illimitable
space. No doubt, when we have learned to contemplate such
vapoury states of attenuated matter, we have learned a great
deal. Modern analysis finds in them the elementary constituents
of our own planetary system; the same elements which
glow with greater apparent brilliancy in our Sun. But this is
not all. To the sober eye of science, those fires, which burned
before stars were kindled, display in their splendours materials
entering into the composition of our transitory frames;
materials required continually by our bodies and by our
productive arts. We live, if modern science may be trusted,
by the assimilation of elements now shining in the celestial
sphere; elements which glittered there through long cycles of
ages before our Earth was. And we employ the same elements
in the common industries of civilisation.<a name="FNanchor_212_267" id="FNanchor_212_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_267" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> This bewildering
thought seems to link us with that Sun, which is the glory of
our day, with those wandering lamps which make night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
beautiful; and with all the hosts of heaven, which have always
fascinated the upward gaze of man, and have sometimes won
his heart to worship them.</p>

<p>The more overwhelming these thoughts appear, the grander
is the emphasis of our yet unanswered question. We have
seen that we are able to travel backwards&mdash;not in fancy,
but in reason&mdash;from era to era, however incalculable the
measurement of each era may be; and, when our travels have
reached their utmost goal, we find the marvellous Continuity
of Nature still unbroken. And this very fact, is, in itself,
a sufficient proof that we have not approached Time's antecedents.
What we have really done, is to carry the Present
with us into an immeasurably distant Past. We know not
yet what is presupposed by both,&mdash;we cannot say what went
before them.</p>

<p>It is <em>very</em> important for us to be thoroughly clear upon the
result. For there is a sort of unreflecting idea afloat, that if
vast periods of Time are conceived, the whole Universe is conceived
also. All seems explained, since everything may come
to pass in Time! So it may, in <em>one</em> sense. Time gives opportunity;
but then there must be a moving power<a name="FNanchor_213_268" id="FNanchor_213_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_268" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> to work <em>in</em>
the opportunity. Let it therefore be distinctly borne in mind,
that Time causes nothing. To dispense with a spring of action,
is to imagine that Time will stop the river's flow, or that the
river will stop without a cause in time:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>In reality, Time accounts neither for good nor for evil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
neither for the end nor yet for the beginning of any single
work.</p>

<p>And the same is true respecting any chain, however long, made
up of antecedents and consequents, however numerous. We
see in them movements propagating movements; but then we
are obliged to ask, what moved the first of them? The reader
may remember Professor Huxley's picture of a cosmic vapour,
from a knowledge of which a sufficient Intelligence might have
predicted our present world. Looking further, we find this
cosmic vapour to be composed (as he says) of molecules
possessing forces or properties; in other words, what he really
described was a potential Universe; not a Cause, but an
already caused production. What, then, caused it?</p>

<p>It was not the Professor's business,&mdash;nor is it the business
of any Physiologist or of any Physicist, to explain what lies
beyond the territories of his science. Consequently he does
<em>not</em> account for the existence of this "primitive nebulosity."
The "sufficient Intelligence" is only spoken of a possible
interpreter or prophet. And Professor Huxley is right and
wise in his reticence.</p>

<p>Professor Tyndall is equally wise and right in telling us
that "Science knows much of this intermediate phase of things
that we call nature, of which it is the product; but science
knows nothing of the origin or destiny of nature."<a name="FNanchor_214_269" id="FNanchor_214_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_269" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>There is always a rightness and wisdom in stating a limit,
and an issue, <em>distinctly</em>. No one endowed with clearness of
vision, will think the Universe as likely to be adequately
accounted for by an eternal nebula, as by an eternity of Mind.
No one will exactly state to himself, the meaning of such
words as Chance, Time, Law, and others of a like description;
and, with those meanings <em>in remembrance</em>, pronounce that any
or all of them can explain the origin of anything. But by
popular lecturers and article-makers, immeasurable series of
conditions are sometimes mentioned in a manner which almost
implies that, because immeasurable, the speaker or writer
supposes that such conditions may possibly be creative.</p>

<p>Any reader of current literature will scarcely need reminding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
that most modern <i>savants</i> usually acquiesce in, and feel burdened
by, a sense of "the Inscrutable." And therefore, when
summing up the results of scientific truth, they honestly and
consistently reduce their disciples to an <em>alternative</em>,&mdash;an alternative
of which no disciple of any special science ought reasonably
to complain. Choose, they tell him, between confessing,
"here is the Incomprehensible&mdash;here I rest;" or, if you please,
endeavouring to "find other means of knowledge, which we do
<em>not</em> pretend to furnish." This is no more than to say, and say
fairly, "Be satisfied with such information as we can give,&mdash;or,
if you please, inquire elsewhere." And this seems reasonable;
for who would assert that a Professor of Poetry ought to
give competent instruction in the Calculus?</p>

<p>We may assume that every student of Natural Theology has
made up his mind to "inquire elsewhere." And it is the part
of an earnest man so to do. Were not the Future linked to the
Present, we all might feel less earnest, less persevering, less
anxious for inquiry. Yet, if there be a Future beyond our
Present, we at once perceive a weight of reason beyond all
powers of estimate, <em>why</em> such a connecting chain must certainly
exist. All our experience, every argument from analogy,
and all morality, fall into one and the same scale. But of
this, more hereafter. There is no doubt that our wisdom and
our duty coincide with our natural instincts, in bringing us to
this resolution. We may not be able to learn <em>all</em> we could
wish of that Future which follows our present; but what we
can truly learn is to us a treasure beyond price. Let us, therefore,
proceed as fellow-pilgrims in the search.</p>

<p>It is an undeniable fact&mdash;one amongst the hard and actual
facts which life teaches&mdash;that, in the whole of our experience,
we never know of more than one kind of cause,&mdash;a cause, that
is, in the true sense of <em>originating</em> any event or series of events.
Nothing can be more certain as respects our knowledge of the
material world. From this point of view, Sir J. Herschel
describes Brown's book on "Cause and Effect" as "a work
of great acuteness and subtlety of reasoning on some points,
but in which the whole train of argument is vitiated by one
enormous oversight; the omission, namely, of a <em>distinct and
immediate personal consciousness of causation</em> in his enumera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>tion
of that <em>sequence of events</em>, by which the volition of the
mind is made to terminate in the motion of material objects.
I mean the consciousness of <em>effort</em>, accompanied with <em>intention
thereby</em> to accomplish an end, as a thing entirely distinct from
mere <em>desire</em> or <em>volition</em> on the one hand, and from mere
spasmodic contraction of muscles on the other."<a name="FNanchor_215_270" id="FNanchor_215_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_270" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>This causation we experience continually. A heavy stone
falls from a wall, and kills a man. No one threw it. We say
it fell&mdash;or, as a physicist might express it, obeyed the law of
gravitation. But we may remember that from the tower of
Thebez "a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon
Abimelech's head and all to break his scull." We form quite
a different opinion of this event. We say, here is a case in
which "the volition of the mind is made to terminate in the
motion of a material object." Some might accuse, others
excuse, the woman of Thebez; but all would argue that she
caused the death of Abimelech.</p>

<p>Your boy wants to beat a chair which has fallen upon him;
you tell him why he must not, and all you say is sound
philosophy. He also wants to kill his cat for devouring his
canary bird; and again you philosophize correctly. But,
suppose your young philosopher for his own pleasure wrings
his canary bird's neck? The chair fell by mechanical law&mdash;the
cat obeyed the law of her hungry instinct&mdash;but your boy is
culpable. He was the true cause of his own cruel act,&mdash;in a
word he was responsible. And this same truth of Causation,
involved in Responsibility, and constituting one of its necessary
factors, is like Mind in Mr. Mill,&mdash;a truth which we
<em>must</em> accept&mdash;inexplicable, but unquestionably real. We <em>know</em>
that Will is a Cause,&mdash;and we do <em>not</em> actually know of any
other cause in the wide Universe. The fact comes home to us
in a variety of ways. Was Thurtell the cause or the
physical antecedent of Weare's death? If not the cause, we
ought never to think him, or any murderer, slaver, torturer,
or tyrant, at all in the wrong; neither can we hold them in
any manner responsible.</p>

<p>Let the reader put this case to himself in as many different
shapes as he can. The result will always come to the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
issue. We may suppose a Nebula, Law, Force, so arranged as
to be the physical antecedent of a world. And nothing can be
more marvellous than the idea of such an arrangement! But
we cannot imagine any existence really causing an effect,
save one,&mdash;a Will. Therefore, if we wish to go beyond Nebula,
Law, or Force, which are merely physical antecedents,&mdash;and
ask what caused one or all of them, we are obliged (so far as
we are disciples of experience) to say their Cause was a Will.
And when we say this, we allege <em>a sufficient reason</em>.</p>

<p>A few paragraphs back, we availed ourselves of the authoritative
verdict pronounced by scientific thinkers, on the question
of what is, and what is not, from their point of view, knowable.
And we saw <em>where</em> physics terminated,&mdash;that is, in a
<em>Nebula</em>. This is their <em>limit</em>.</p>

<p>Yet, there is nothing to hinder a physicist from becoming
also a Natural Theologian. It is not every man who will rest
in a negative conclusion. Professor Baden Powell was among
the malcontents in this respect; and we desire now to quote
from his writings some passages referred to in the argument of
a former Chapter.</p>

<p>But before doing so, it would be unfair to conceal that a
tribute of gratitude appears due to writers who mark the
boundary of their own thought, however little we ourselves
desire to stay acquiescently within its limitations. There is
honesty in their act;&mdash;there is an incitement for other men to
try out their lines of thinking also. Finally, all such writers
are unexceptionable witnesses to the interest and reality belonging
to a separate science of Natural Theology. In all these
respects, they occupy a totally different position from the
indifferentist or sneering sceptic; and it would be injustice to
confound such broad distinctions of moral aspect. With this
acknowledgment let us return to Baden Powell.</p>

<p>In his "Connexion of Natural and Divine Truth"<a name="FNanchor_216_271" id="FNanchor_216_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_271" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> he writes
thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The study of <em>physical causes</em> (understood <em>in the simple meaning</em>
which we have before endeavoured to fix,) while it supplies the
unassailable evidence of design and adjustment, as unavoidably carries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
us thence onward to the idea of an Intelligence from which that
design emanated, and of an agency by which that adjustment was
produced. It brings us, in a word, to recognise an influence of
another kind, of an order <em>different from</em>, and far above that of <em>physical
causes</em> or material action:&mdash;to acknowledge a sublime <em>moral cause</em>,
the universally operating source of creative power and providential
wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_BD_272" id="FNanchor_BD_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD_272" class="fnanchor">[bd]</a> ... We have already noticed, in other cases, the
ambiguities arising from the diversity of meaning attached to the same
term "cause." Here, then, it becomes more peculiarly necessary if
we adopt the popular expression, "the First Cause," to recur carefully
to the distinction, if we would preserve any clearness of reasoning.</p>

<p>"We refer to senses of the term absolutely distinct <em>in kind</em>. Nor
is it a term of mere verbal difference. It is of importance, whether
in guarding against fallacies in evidence or in answering the cavils of
scepticism.... When we ascend to the contemplation of creative
intelligence, the distinction is not between a prior and a subsequent
train of material action, but between <em>physical order</em> and <em>moral volition</em>.
It will thus be apparent that the metaphor so often used of the <em>chain</em>
of natural causes <em>whose last and highest link</em> is its immediate connexion
with the Deity;&mdash;the very phrase of a succession of <em>secondary</em> causes
traced up to a <em>first cause</em>,&mdash;and the like, (so commonly employed,) are
founded on a totally mistaken analogy.</p>

<p>"If we retain such metaphorical language at all, it would be a
more just mode of speaking to describe the Deity as the Divine
artificer of the whole chain,&mdash;not to connect Him with its links;&mdash;to
represent the secondary causes as combined into joint operation by
His power and will,&mdash;but not to make Him one of them." And again;&mdash;"If
we require the aid of metaphor in attempting to give utterance to
those vast conceptions with which the mind is overpowered, instead
of speaking of the first and secondary links in a chain of causation,
and the like, let us rather recur to the analogy of the <em>arch</em> (before
introduced,) and we shall be adopting at once a more just and
expressive figure, and shall here run no risk of speaking as if we
confounded the stones with the builder,&mdash;their mutually supporting
force with the skill of the architect who adjusted them."<a name="FNanchor_217_273" id="FNanchor_217_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_273" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>
<p>What Baden Powell called "physical causation," is now
more commonly known as invariable antecedency, or invariable
succession. Antecedents and consequents are phenomena of
the natural world,&mdash;and the connection between them is their
<em>Law</em>.</p>

<p>Now, suppose we take the Alphabet to represent a series
of these antecedents and consequents, the latter invariably
following the former; it does not, (as far as argument goes,) in
the least signify what the series really is, any more than when
we calculate algebraically. But to make things plain, let the
Alphabet represent 26 cycles of succession; each cycle containing
as many millions of years, or ages, as you choose to
grant for the duration of the Natural Universe. We may
state the problem thus,&mdash;the <em>law</em> of succession being assumed
in our series as constant.</p>

<p>If we have Z, there certainly must have been Y, and <em>conversely</em>;&mdash;</p>

<p>If there were no Y, there cannot possibly be Z. We go
on,&mdash;</p>

<p>If Y, then certainly X;</p>

<p>If no X, then Y is impossible.</p>

<p>As we know Z in fact, we get back to Y; and, as we
find Y, we retrogress to X.</p>

<p>And the retrogression continues, say till we reach B,&mdash;</p>

<p>If B, certainly A;</p>

<p>If no A, then B is impossible.</p>

<p>But, what are we to say of A?</p>

<p>If A then certainly&mdash;<em>what</em>?</p>

<p>If no <em>what</em>?&mdash;then A is impossible.</p>

<p>It does not signify how far the chain of physical law may
extend. From its very essence and definition, you must arrive
finally at a first link. Or, in other words, the Continuity of
Nature may go back through Time immeasurable,&mdash;Time will
after all lead you to Time's antecedents. And when you have
arrived at your first link, and inquire <em>what</em> must necessarily
have preceded Time, it is well to consider the <em>sort</em> of account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
which alone you can accept, <em>because</em> it alone will <em>sufficiently</em>
satisfy your reason.</p>

<p>You want, then, something which properly accounts first
for A; <em>next</em> for the link between A and B; and <em>thirdly</em>, by
consequence, for the whole Alphabet.</p>

<p>If, with this statement in mind, the reader turns back to the
extracts made from Powell, he will see the force of several
points strongly put by the Professor. He will see, for example,
how inevitably <em>physical</em> causation carries us back to <em>another</em>,
and very <em>diverse</em> Causation,&mdash;diverse in <em>kind</em>&mdash;not simply
different in degree. Also, how the idea of Cause in this latter
sense, takes us quite <em>out</em> of the physical nexus. And, further,
that the only admissible Conception of a First Universal Cause,
must be a conception of something which will not only bring
about A, but likewise <em>account</em> for the entire series, linked
together and consecutive, into one resulting <em>Whole</em>. For the
Whole itself; in brief for the Many and the One.</p>

<p>We have now to ask further, what Facts can tell us respecting
these two kinds of Causation. And let us again
employ our letters, but rather in a different way.</p>

<p>Suppose P stands for a fact, which may also be described as
a natural phenomenon. To account for P we go back to O,
retrogress to N, M, and so on, as shewn already.</p>

<p>Again, suppose another fact which cannot be described as a
natural phenomenon. Let us try whether P may, with equal
propriety, stand for a human production or performance. That
is&mdash;whether, instead of being a mere <em>phenomenal</em> fact, it may
also be spoken of as an <em>act</em>.</p>

<p>We want then to account for P, <em>thus</em> considered. A striking
circumstance appears at once evident, that to find the "<em>why</em>"
of human activity we do not look to any antecedent;&mdash;we look
to a <em>consequent</em>, or a series of consequences. The question we
ask is,&mdash;with what <em>view</em> P became an act? In other words,
we try to account for P, <em>not</em> by <em>O</em>, <em>N</em>, <em>M</em>, etc., but by <em>Q</em>, <em>R</em>, <em>S</em>,
etc. For example: let P represent a murder. The crime was
done for the sake of money, and for things which money will
purchase; that is, the <em>consequents</em>,&mdash;<em>Q</em>, <em>R</em>, <em>S</em>, and so on, forming
a series designed;&mdash;gains and purposes, long or short. But, no
one would say that <em>another</em> series <em>foregoing</em> (O, N, M) <em>ne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>cessitated
the act</em>;&mdash;that they were the <em>certain antecedents of a
necessary consequent</em> (P) <em>the murder</em>. If it were so, we should
have to congratulate the murderer for having been <em>forced</em> into
so profitable a performance, and we should also have to leave
him in the peaceable enjoyment of his profits.</p>

<p>Acts, therefore,&mdash;or <em>volitional</em> facts&mdash;move <em>forwards</em> through
a series of <em>consequents</em>; while phenomena&mdash;that is, <em>physical</em>
facts&mdash;run backwards through a series of <em>antecedents</em>.</p>

<p>If pressed to find a Cause for an act, we are never in a position
to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>If P, then certainly O;</p>

<p>If no O, then P is impossible.</p>

<p>We say, on the contrary, that the <em>Cause</em> of the act was
<em>Volitional</em>,&mdash;that is, it was done by an <em>agent or person acting</em>.
And further, that the <em>consequents</em> (Q, R, S, etc.) represent the
<em>purpose</em> of the actor or agent, and that he is responsible for
having adopted them as his prevalent motives or inducements.</p>

<p>But from these necessities of thought which hold alike as
abstract truths, and in practical experience, several inferences
follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>A volitional cause or agent, may stand before a series of
consequents;&mdash;but cannot be ranged after such a series.</p>

<p>Our series represented by the Alphabet, was taken to be a
series of <em>invariable sequency</em>. That is, each factor (letter)
presupposed antecedents, which <em>necessitated</em> every factor in
succession. Therefore we cannot represent any agent or volitional
Cause, by an element (or letter) of that series at all.
Nor yet his act. It follows on no such chain of antecedents.
It is done <em>in view</em> of certain consequents.</p>

<p>If, therefore, we ask what can be conceived respecting the
causation of the Universe,&mdash;its cause must (as Powell says),
be placed absolutely outside and prior to the whole series.
In other words,&mdash;a volitional or First cause can never belong
to the physical chain of antecedent and consequent, bound
together by natural law. And the reason is plain: in no true
sense can such Cause ever be a necessary consequent at all.
Such a Cause calls into existence, not only A, but the whole
consecutive alphabet, representing cycles of millions of ages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
Not the world's primæval state alone,&mdash;- but the whole law-connected
Universe. Thus, First Cause, and Secondary cause,
apply not to difference of sequency alone,&mdash;but to an <em>intrinsic
and essential distinction</em>. And, this distinction is so vast,
that between the World's First Cause, and any given Secondary
cause, there is fixed a gulf of separation as wide as the whole
potential Universe.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at the subject of Causation may
appear simpler to some minds.</p>

<p>Let the reader recal the problems of Idealism and Realism
already discussed. He will also remember what Mr. Masson
calls "the paramount result" to Mill and Hamilton alike;&mdash;the
inevitable persuasion all men have of their own distinctness
from an external world of things and persons surrounding
them.</p>

<p>With this accepted result in remembrance, let the reader
ask himself the further question, <em>how</em> he became originally
impressed with the grand division of that world of objectivity,&mdash;how
he first separated <em>Persons</em> from <em>Things</em>? He will account
for the conception in some such way as this:&mdash;As a child, he
was injured both by his nurse and his nursery table. He
discovered that the table had been placed where it stood;
but that his nurse struck him with a passionate intention of
compelling him to obey her, against his own will. And, thus,
in the succession of little troubles and events perpetually going
on, he learned to distinguish them all into two broad classes:
events dependent on previous circumstances, such as the
position of the table; and events productive of intentional
consequences, such as the ill temper of his nurse. The first
class of events he could <em>control</em> by a change of outside conditions;&mdash;he
could either move the table or keep his body out
of its way. But, the nurse he had to humour and conciliate;
and he soon found, to his cost, that very often his efforts to win
her favour were unavailing, because her temper was so very,
very bad. And this whole process of Childish reasoning became
confirmed in after life by his practical reason, and
verified by finding it work well every day. The child who
thus ceases to blame the table for hurting him, but blames the
temper of the nurse, is the "father of the Man," who praises or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
blames only when he discovers a true <em>cause</em>; and steadily
ascribes <em>Causation</em> to a <em>Will</em>. And, employ what words we
choose, this causative power is the grand tenable distinction
between Persons and Things. And no amount of refined
theory will ever induce us to act upon any other supposition.
We remain fixed in our belief that a true Cause must, without
exception, be always a true Personality.</p>

<p>It is worth while observing, likewise, with what emphasis
of words, mankind marks its sense of this fact. We all say
that we see such and such a <em>cause</em>,&mdash;or such and such a <em>will</em>
at work. And the energy of expression is justified by analysis.
For, when we see an orange or a cathedral, what we really
perceive through our eye, may be summed as coloured surface,
outline, light and shade. And seeing this, we say that we see
the <em>solid</em>;&mdash;that is, seeing effects, we maintain that we see the
cause. Moreover, this is true, if we remember that seeing is a
compound process; the eye of the mind looking <em>through</em> the
eye of the body. And we ventured to use the same language
in our last chapter, and also to justify it, when we spoke of
seeing the Intelligible. The man, therefore, is not far wrong
who says that he sees God everywhere.</p>

<p>Look at the subject in whatever point of view we will,&mdash;as
an abstract question&mdash;as a calculable problem&mdash;or an affair of
plain common sense,&mdash;the result must finally come to one and
the same thing. There can be no Cause,&mdash;no First to stand
before (not in) the series of sequences, except a Being, Will,
Personality.</p>

<p>Now as a matter of truth, there must necessarily exist some
sufficient account of the Universe. Physical Science is right
to speak of it as unknowable<a name="FNanchor_218_274" id="FNanchor_218_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_274" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> by Physical investigation. It
cannot lie <em>in</em> the physical series,&mdash;it must stand <em>prior</em> to the
whole. It admits of no antecedent; but the sum of all existence
is its consequent. Therefore, the sufficient account is a first
Being, Will, and Personality. We must accept the result and
acknowledge its truth, because it is an inevitable fact, if the
question is argued upon the ground of other facts practically
known, and not of theory, conjecture, or supposed possibilities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
But it involves theoretical difficulties which we must acknowledge
to be inexplicable. We cannot, however, forget that
many other truths and matters of fact are inexplicable also.<a name="FNanchor_219_275" id="FNanchor_219_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_275" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>A circumstance equally true, and equally incapable of
theoretical explanation, may be stated as follows. If we revert,
once more, to our representative letters of the alphabet, it will
be recollected that the letter P was taken to represent a crime,&mdash;a
murder for the sake of gain. P had for its consequents
<em>Q</em>, <em>R</em>, <em>S</em>, but did not depend on the antecedents <em>O</em>, <em>N</em>, <em>M</em>; it
was introduced extraneously into the series. In other words,
the crime entailed a number of <em>effects</em>, which had in reality been
premeditated by the murderer; while, <em>in itself</em>, it was to be
<em>accounted</em> for only as the act of a Volitional Cause or Agent.
And the remarkable point to us now, is the circumstance that
such a <em>designed series of events</em> can thus be introduced into
the order of nature by <em>man's spontaneous choice</em>. These
determinations are in fact alterations in the ordinary course
of Nature; and contradictions of its absolutely invariable
sequency.<a name="FNanchor_BE_276" id="FNanchor_BE_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE_276" class="fnanchor">[be]</a> This fact, again, appears to be theoretically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
inexplicable, yet is practically true; and we <em>verify</em> its truth by
determinations of the deepest interest and importance to our
individual selves. Sometimes, men almost stand aghast at the
consequences of choosing obstinately; and, through years of
sorrow, accuse their own, and their friends' pertinacity.</p>

<p>Possibly, the difficulty in theory may be in some degree
softened by the admissions of physical philosophers,&mdash;inventors
and craftsmen of all sorts,&mdash;respecting the considerable <em>allowance</em>
to be made for "functioning" their abstract calculations.
The necessity of such allowance distinctly proves, that, even
in the most exact of applied sciences, pure theory and practical
result do not commonly coincide. And, when we look to the
concerns of human society, it must be confessed that no amount
of sovereign power, insight of statesmen, or experience grounded
on precedent or on knowledge of mankind, does away with the
absolute necessity of allowing what is called a "<em>margin</em>" for
the actual working of any law, scheme, contrivance, or political
constitution. Speculative people are apt to find this truth
verified to their cost and disappointment; and, perhaps, one
reason for the general success of English administrators in
government and colonization, is their habit of making <em>very
large</em> allowances throughout all the practical arrangements. In
managing the world, they consider the <em>non-calculable</em> element
of Will,&mdash;and allow for the way in which it breaks in, with
sometimes tremendous effect, upon the otherwise regular
current of affairs.</p>

<p>But if this be true of the <em>human</em> Will, what ought to be said</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>of the <em>Divine</em>? If we, with our limited power and understanding,
can thus interrupt many series of events in our world,
what shall we say concerning the Volitional Cause of the whole
Universe? Concerning a Personality, which was before the
chain of phenomenal antecedent and consequent began, and
Which (as we have shewn must hold true of a First Cause),
actually willed the whole <em>as a whole</em>, and arranged the end
from the beginning? Recurring to our selected figure of the
Alphabet, this primary Will, this incomprehensible Person is,
in our view, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the
End, and beside Him there is none other.<a name="FNanchor_220_277" id="FNanchor_220_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_277" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>So far, therefore, as a consideration of the world goes, and of
mankind as existing in the world, arguments from analogy
would lead to some positive expectation of Miracles. Our
belief in the Uniformity of Nature does not exclude them;
and our practical experience gives rise to a <em>probability</em> of their
occurrence. When, however, we lift up our eyes to the Divine
Mind as Supreme Reason, Miracles appear to us inconceivable
without an adequate occasion. For we ourselves strive to act
on <em>true</em>, <em>fitting</em>, and <em>reasonable</em> grounds of purpose; and
shall we think less of Him, "Who teacheth Man knowledge"?
But to pursue this last topic as it deserves, would carry us
away from the domain of Natural Theology, and into that of
Theology true and proper.</p>

<p>Our business has lain with the Natural world, human nature
itself included. And in examining the successional chain, we
have perceived that it is not forged of Adamant. Yet there is
so much connection and unity running throughout it, that we
may with the greatest justice speak of the <em>order</em> and <em>course</em> of
nature. And, perhaps the <em>highest</em> kind of evidence to the being
and attributes of God conceivable by us, lies in the concurrence
of <em>two</em> separate kinds of proof; both resting on the reality of
Divine <em>causation</em> viewed <em>relatively</em> to the World we inhabit.
The one,&mdash;when we trace (as in this Chapter we have shewn
that men ought to trace), the chain of natural sequence up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
a Personal First Cause. The other,&mdash;when we find reason to
believe that the First Cause and Creator of the world, has seen
fit to interfere with its orderly course in a manner which
distinguishes His intervention from our common every-day
experience.</p>

<p>For such intervention, <em>we</em> could probably conceive no greater
fitness, no nobler occasion, than the purpose of raising Men
above themselves, and assuring them that there are more things
in Heaven and Earth than are dreamed of in their Philosophies.
And what human dream, vision, or philosophy, could
ever have foreseen the things which God hath prepared for
them that love Him?</p>

be the chief element of Paganism: recognition of Man, and his Moral
Duty, though this too is not wanting, comes to be the chief element only
in purer forms of religion. Here, indeed, is a great distinction and epoch
in Human Beliefs; a great landmark in the religious development of
Mankind. Man first puts himself in relation with Nature and her
Powers, wonders and worships over those; not till a later epoch does

<p>"The world that I regard is myself; it is the microcosm of mine own

and turn it round sometimes for my recreation. Men that look upon my
outside, perusing only my condition and fortunes, do err in my altitude;
for I am above Atlas his shoulders. The earth is a point not only in
respect of the heavens above us, but of that heavenly and celestial part
within us: that mass of flesh that circumscribes me, limits not my mind:
that surface that tells the heavens it hath an end, cannot persuade me I
have any: I take my circle to be above three hundred and sixty; though
the number of the arc do measure my body, it comprehendeth not my
mind: whilst I study to find how I am a microcosm, or little world, I
find myself something more than the great. There is surely a piece of
divinity in us, something that was before the elements, and owes no
homage unto the sun."</p>

<p class="center">SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTER VII.</p>


<p class="hang">The object of this Chapter is to shew that the universally enforced
maxim of Responsibility unites in itself <em>two</em> factors.</p>

<p>(1.) A true power of Causation, as explained in Chapter VI.</p>

<p>(2.) A moral distinction of Right and Wrong.</p>

<p class="hang">This <em>second</em> element of Responsibility is next investigated, and the Moral
antithesis shewn to be inalienable. Right can never be Wrong, nor
Wrong ever Right. Justice must certainly prevail at last.</p>

<p class="hang">From the connection of Morality with Causation, it may be inferred that
the moral Law has its ultimate existence in a Supreme Personality&mdash;a
just and sovereign God. This conclusion is verified. Human life
and Human death read us the same lesson.</p>


<p class="hang"><i>Corollary.</i>&mdash;If the conclusion just drawn be accepted, and to know God
be Life Eternal, we may also infer an <i lang="la">à priori</i> probability of some
Supernatural assistances, intended to strengthen our human weaknesses
and diminish our ignorance. This latter purpose would seem
likely to include a better aid to happiness, and a more complete code
of Moral Maxims.</p>


<p class="hang"><i>Analysis.</i>&mdash;As a social fact, Responsibility is universal, and accounted
inalienable by any individual man. Responsibility involves Causation
in the highest sense, together with Moral Sensibility.</p>

<p class="hang">Attempts to refine away ethical Rightness. An appeal to consciousness
proposed:&mdash;Distinctness of moral feeling;&mdash;and its <em>Permanence</em>.
Antithesis of Right and Wrong an irreconcileable Antagonism.
Contrasted with correlation of Power and Function; this antithesis
never fluent, but rigorous, immutable, imperishable, absolute. Ultimate
coincidence of Happiness with Virtue is a necessary result
of Independent Morality.</p>

<p class="hang">Moral Law exists conceivably in and by a Will alone; as&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Its cause and spring of movement.</p>

<p>2. Its source of expression and practical authority.</p>

<p class="hang">Being supreme, it exists in and by a Supreme Moral Will or Personality.
That is to say, in and by God.</p>

<p class="hang">This conception verified. World inexplicable without Man. Man inexplicable
without God; Whom to know is Life Eternal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Corollary.</i>&mdash;Supernatural assistance apparently to be expected when
Moral Law is viewed as a human endowment proceeding from God.
Thus Man is made for God, and God has not made Man in vain.</p>


<p class="hang">Confirmation from&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Image of Divine Love in Nature.
2. Nature of religious Trust as a Belief of Reason.
3. Incompleteness of our ethical knowledge apart from such assistance.
4. Universal expectation of Mankind.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="center">RESPONSIBILITY.</p>


<p>Responsibility is the most serious fact of our whole human
world. The affairs of life could not go on for a single day if
there were no Responsibility. We never release any man
from its burden, without incapacitating him, at the same
time, alike from business and from enjoyment. We lay it
upon childhood, as soon as the child is able to reflect upon
his own actions and to choose deliberately;&mdash;we do not take
it away from a collected and self-controlled age. And every
reasonable Man who stands by an open grave, or knows that
he is rapidly approaching his own, feels, (above all other
pressures,) the unending prospect of Responsibility. Looking
at this prospect, we look into our deepest solitude;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<span class="i0">"Since all alone, so Heaven has willed, we die."</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>None of our fellows, the dear companions of our Soul, can
carry our burden then. And though they walk by our side in
life, and cheer us with their love, they cannot really bear that
burden <em>now</em>. And, thus, in the most serious and solemn fact
of our existence, we are always isolated and alone.</p>

<p>But Responsibility is something better to every one of us
than a burden;&mdash;it is also an incalculable benefit. A man
who has no true sense of responsibility, is an unformed human
being;&mdash;and, in proportion as we feel it inwardly, and express
the feeling by consideration and self-control, we make progress
in real manliness. On this account, Responsibility may be
pronounced our chief aid in the formation of a manly character.
And, probably, among all the sources of human
happiness, none yields a more unbroken serenity, than the
habitual consciousness of being enabled to act up to the single
mark of our responsibilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>When a man has attained such practical wisdom, it "maketh
his face to shine." His daily endeavour to do right, instead of
causing him anxiety and disquietude, gives a buoyancy to the
spirit; which shows itself in a peculiar brightness of countenance,
unlike every other cheerful glance and aspect. The
beaming faces, with which early Italian artists painted their
good men and saintly women, are excellent illustrations of this
expressional beauty.</p>

<p>Let us consider, through one chapter more, what Natural
Theology has to say upon this subject.</p>

<p>Responsibility has been shewn to involve, as one of its constituent
principles, an idea of <em>Causation</em>. It is, also, clear
that to hold a man responsible, he must be supposed to possess
some power of distinguishing Right from Wrong. In our last
chapter, we drew from the principle of Causation certain conclusions
regarding the Universal First Cause. We have now
to examine the principle of Moral Sensibility.</p>

<p>Every one at all acquainted with modern controversy, is
aware that few questions have been more keenly mooted, than
the <em>origin</em> of moral distinctions among mankind. The debate
respecting them has run, for a great part of its course, parallel
with that on the origin of our primary intellectual beliefs,
alluded to in a former chapter. Neither of these controversies
concerns us beyond a certain point. Our business lies with the
facts of human nature, rather than with theories concerning
any supposed possibilities as to their growth and accretion.
But, one caution we suggested respecting the case of intellect,
holds good and is important to every moral inquirer. <em>Let the
analyst beware of his alembic!</em> There is nothing more easy
than to vaporize reality altogether, by way of exalting a
philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_221_278" id="FNanchor_221_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_278" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> And in Morality, the result is far worse than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
in speculation. The distinctive character of our Moral Consciousness
is the "essence" which lends to a right action its
peculiar fragrance and beauty. Invaluable <i lang="la">per se</i>, it will
surely be found of a nature so delicate and fugitive as to
escape the tests of analytic psychologists. Yet when this is
fled, the residuum must be worthless to Moral philosophy.</p>

<p>The "essence" just mentioned, merits a few minutes' attention.
Men have been known to assert that their feeling of
appreciation in respect of a very lovely woman, was precisely
similar to their appreciation of a handsome horse. No doubt,
the right answer is to tell such a man that he is utterly blind
to the true loveliness of woman; and does not deserve to call
a creature so excellent, his wife. You may, also, point out to
him the various distinctive characters of female excellence,&mdash;refinement,
purity, depth of feeling, self devotion, the noblest
heroism, and so on. But if the man has put all his perceptions
of diverse excellences into a private alembic, and sublimated
them into one of the lowest among æsthetic susceptibilities;
no argument will really convince him. The truly bright
æsthetic eye&mdash;the grander imaginative powers are wanting,&mdash;the
man is mentally colour-blind.</p>

<p>The same truth holds good of theorists who tell us dogmatically
that our Moral Sensibility is nothing better than an
accretion of baser materials which may be stripped off from
each other in the reverse order of their growth, just like the
coats of a stalactite or a tulip-root. As may readily be surmised,
there is great difference of dogma, when judgment
comes to be pronounced on the <em>moral core</em> and <em>centre</em> of the
whole. Some are for the needs of society,&mdash;some utility in
general,&mdash;the greater part for individual advantage. Others
take theoretically polar directions; and with them, rightness
consists either in quietism, or else in self-immolation. Self-approving
feelings, (each advocate tells us,) have clustered
round his pet growing point; and the clustering has endowed
us with all the moral sense we happen to possess. Here again,
it is doubtful whether a right answer will convince the experimentalist,
bent on turning lead into gold. Yet whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
convincing or not, most honest hearts would prompt an indignant
rejoinder. The world at large, however, is likely to
prove a more successful arbiter. The utilitarian will find that
he excites little sympathy even when general utility forms his
moral kernel;&mdash;and, when it is no more than a personal gain
of worldly advantages, he will not improbably be called a
rascal. Then "Quietism" can never hope much favour in the
busy workshop of the West. Though it may seem strange to
some minds, self-immolation has by far the greatest chance of
winning suffrages; one chief reason being, that the man who
sacrifices his own private advantage, has evidently spurned
expediency and selfishness. Even those who think his
theoretical views erroneous&mdash;and possibly mischievous, will
applaud his victory over the meaner passions.</p>

<p>Each hour of thought the reader can bestow on moral distinctions,
will turn to certain good. At the very least, it must
help to form a habit of self-examination. And for this purpose,
very simple interrogatories bring out very useful responses.
If the reader be a rose grower, let him inquire into his own
feelings, when he plucks the fairest flower in his garden, to
give fragrance and colour to the sick room of a poor but
sensitive little invalid. He will certainly perceive a wide
interval between his pleasure in admiring the glowing rose,
and his pleasure in adding to the scanty luxuries of the
poor sick child. Thus, although a benevolent action be a truly
beautiful thing, yet there is a difference between the rose
grower's impressions of mere beauty, and of pure benevolence.
A difference too between his enjoyment of beauty, and his
enjoyment in benevolently resigning to another, the object
which charmed him because it was beautiful. Time, also,
makes a vast difference between the two emotions. We
cannot recal a delicious odour, as truly as we can reproduce
a pretty sight before our retrovertive eye. The image of
the rose remains, after its sweet fragrance has departed. But
much, much longer than either, remains the moral impression
graved upon the mind. That little pleasure enjoyed in a brief
self-denial, will repeat itself through half a century of years.</p>

<p>Permanence is, indeed, one characteristic which demonstrates
the paramount excellence of all moral impressions. It is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
<em>difficult</em> to repeat to ourselves the sensation of physical pleasure
or physical pain, that many writers on pathologic topics speak
of it as a thing impossible. Certainly, its greatest vividness is
in dreams; and above all, "ægri somnia"&mdash;sick visions&mdash;seem
to possess the strongest reproductive power. It is curious,
however, to observe the manner in which dreams themselves
put on a moral meaning. Who does not remember Sir W.
Scott's lines in the "Lady of the Lake," on the returning
phantoms of early youth,&mdash;change, loss, and separation? But
those phantoms are pale shadows, compared with what we
have all felt in our visionary hours,&mdash;the consciousness of our
own absolute loneliness,&mdash;of our death,&mdash;of a hopeless, endless
isolation. Even the very thought of our spiritual life,<a name="FNanchor_222_279" id="FNanchor_222_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_279" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> as
distinguished from mere corporeal life, is terrible to us and
hardly to be borne. So overwhelming is the idea of the
demand of Justice upon each of us;&mdash;the law of human
Responsibility.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, too, that the most common-sense practical
people sometimes feel these impressions the most acutely. One
reason may arise from the circumstance, that the spiritually
imaginative temperament of such persons is vigorous,&mdash;has
few occasions of employment; and throws its unexhausted
force into those strong "Michel-Angelesque" realizations.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought on this point, there is no truth
of our whole Manhood more striking, as well as more evident,
than the <em>independent vitality</em> of our Moral Consciousness.
Let us suppose, for example's sake, that the reader was once
unhappy enough to injure a neighbour, a friend, or relation.
Let the injury be something which you in your heart know
to be truly injurious;&mdash;a thing impossible in your better
moments,&mdash;but still a thing done. Now, let years elapse, and
when the thought recurs and the deed is reacted, you feel how
wrongful it was. And when you grow old, and there are few
left to love you, the feeling will become far more deep. Put
oceans, continents, tropics, between yourself and your injured
one; the reality is not at all less real. The same stars no
longer look down upon you by night,&mdash;the sun does not bring
back the same seasons at the same time,&mdash;but your act is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
<em>Timeless</em>;&mdash;and, though night and day vary, its criminality
remains the same. And worst of all,&mdash;the injured one may die,
whilst no act of reparation may have been performed by
you,&mdash;no word of love or ruth escaped your lips. The deed is
irremediable, and you are the doer of it. Neither Space nor
Duration of years can alter the fact. There is a moral mark
set upon your conscience; and no human sympathy can heal,
nor even alleviate the sorrow. Most likely, you never attempt
to explain to others the pain you feel, because were the case
another's you would hardly comprehend it yourself. Thousands
have gone to the grave, carrying heavy burdens of this kind
almost or altogether unsuspected.</p>

<p>Exemption from the laws of Time and Space, is perhaps the
most <em>wonderful</em> characteristic of our Moral Consciousness.
With this solitary exception, we seem to find ourselves in perpetual
subjection to those laws. But in the realm of Morals it
is the reverse. The endless theoretical contradictions about the
Finite and the Infinite, (to which we have more than once
alluded,) bear witness to this fact. Morality at once puts the
two together;&mdash;what in its sphere of commission was a finite
crime, is likewise an infinite immorality. We count up our
faults as sins; but, when viewed awhile in the light of conscience,
they are most burdensome to us as being, not <em>sins</em>, but
<em>Sin</em>. Look at the pre-Christian Eumenides; the last writing
of St. John the Evangelist; the confessions of Augustine;
and the life of John Bunyan; to which we might add more
than one great Oxford life;&mdash;and, through them all, the profound
sense of Sin underlies every other utterance.</p>

<p>Another salient character of the moral sense, actually existing
among mankind, may be outlined as follows. We have
already considered the manner in which laws appear to human
intelligence, as types, ideas, or relations. Amongst them, we
paid particular attention to the relativity between Power
and Function. And, when viewing these as polar opposites,
with a chain or nexus between them, we saw that the
opposition was, in a certain sense, <em>fluent</em>. Function changed
into Power more than once, before each complex process of
production became entirely accomplished. Power, in accomplishing
its errand, continually was lost, and vanished away in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
Function. But between Right and Wrong, the opposition is
fixed, contradictory, and enduring. Any Logic or Rhetoric
which attempts to make the antithesis appear fluent, is justly
condemned as special pleading, and the art of an oratorical
Sophist. The only question asked of the Sophistical speaker,
is whether the error he tries to excuse was wilful, or unintentional;
whether it was a mistake, or a confusion of
distinctly-opposed moral dictates. So Demosthenes says to
&OElig;schines, "Among all other men I observe these principles and
these distinctions to prevail. Does any one wilfully do wrong?
He is the object of indignation and of punishment. Does any
one commit an error unintentionally? He is pardoned, not
punished.... All this is established not only in all our
jurisprudence, but by Nature herself in her unwritten laws,
and in the very constitution of the human mind."<a name="FNanchor_223_280" id="FNanchor_223_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_280" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>And we may all feel quite sure that this is the normal
decision of Mankind.</p>

<p>Right and Wrong stand out as irreconcileable antagonists,
contending for the empire of the world. A man who watches
the strife without deep interest, and never mingles in the fray
because he thinks its issue immaterial, is no better than a
Pessimist.</p>

<p>Compare a Duty with a Function, (in the wide sense we
assigned to the latter conception,) and two points will at once
be evident. First, how strong the contrast, how wide the
interval, between the Law of productive work, and the law
of moral activity. Secondly, how inextinguishable the contradiction
between Right and Wrong. One man undertakes
some mechanical utilitarian function, dependent on the pleasure
or life of a superior; to whom he is in no other respect bound,
nor in any way accountable. Another is a husband, a father, or
a son. The object of his natural affection, is also the being to
whom his tender offices of devotion are morally due. For
different reasons, the daily lives of both these men have
become first irksome,&mdash;then, very wearisome,&mdash;finally, almost
odious to themselves. The man of routine goes to visit his
ailing superior, and is permitted to enter the sick room. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
undraws a curtain and looks upon the face of a dead man.
Between the departed and himself, there existed no natural
love, nor any acquired hate, neither duty nor demand. The
link was simply official, and it is broken. Next month, there
will be a new Superior who knows not Joseph. Another
subordinate will occupy the post of routine; and, under the
circumstances, to be released from the old toil is a sort of
happiness. The tedious function of the past is over; and
he carries his powers into a more hopeful employment. Yet
Man is always something to Man, if both are genuine; and
there arise a thousand regretful memories, and thoughts of
kindly interchange of gestures, looks, and words. After a
time, the last change of all is thought of as a thing to be
deplored, but gone by,&mdash;a thing simply irremediable.</p>

<p>But how different, when the man who has been morally
bound&mdash;say the son&mdash;sees a dead face upturned from his
father's pillow! Here is another link of service broken;&mdash;service
of another kind,&mdash;a duty. It is gone, the sick bed
attendance, the harass, the vexation, endured with a recalcitrant
feeling, and sometimes an openly determined opposition.
And how much is gone besides! The feeling of resistance
vanishes, when there is no longer a Will to be resisted; the
harass and vexation appear unwholesome phantoms. To look
on the life of a father or a near friend, after death, is like
looking on a moonlighted landscape; its harsher features
are lost in lengthening shadow; all that we thought rugged
and stern, appears subdued and blended with a thousand
fondly-remembered softnesses. A mild and silvery radiance
flows over the whole familiar scene;&mdash;we gaze and sigh,&mdash;and
sigh and gaze again. To think of its becoming veiled from
our eyes, seems like losing a portion of our own existence.</p>

<p>And what more is gone besides? The son's thought, which
used to mingle so strangely with his feelings of distaste,&mdash;that,
some day, he would fill up the measure of that which was consciously
lacking in his filial duty and devotion. He has now
no power of offering sorrow to obtain the remission of claims
unsatisfied, no possibility of saying, "Father, I have sinned"!
He would die by inches, if, with each slow degree of mortality
he could revoke a short period of the Past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>In other concerns of life all beyond human cure is also
beyond human care; but this concern is a matter of Right and
Wrong. To say the Wrong is irremediable, is to utter the
sharpest cry of Remorse,&mdash;the last word of a long Despair.</p>

<p>It is always thus, when the moral rule intervenes. It is so,
when an injured friend dies,&mdash;the injurer is fast bound by the
crime he has committed. It is so, when the Son thinks he has
to face things undone which ought to have been done,&mdash;the
opportunity of doing them now lost for ever. Inability to
remedy a wrong makes our sorrow inextinguishable. And we
know by experience, that such a sorrow is unlike every other
sorrow. It differs in <em>kind</em> from all trains of ordinary feeling,
and seems to belong less to our emotional life than to be a
dictate of our sovereign reason. And the moral rule is so. In
the eye of Practical Reason which (so far as human nature
goes), constitutes our supreme guide, a claim of Morality is
absolutely rigorous&mdash;absolutely supreme&mdash;and if unsatisfied,
absolutely inexorable.</p>

<p>To suppose anything less, would be to annihilate the whole
moral law. For, how can you, or I, or any one, be required
to immolate our life, freedom, fortune, or even our ordinary
enjoyments, unless the rule be perfectly unyielding; perfectly
unchangeable? To be binding <em>now</em>,&mdash;it must be binding under
<em>all</em> circumstances, and binding <em>always</em>. If a single claim
remain unsatisfied the admission is fatal. Broken once, the
law is broken everlastingly. Every man might conceive that
his own case was, possibly, just one marked for exception.
Who, then, would sacrifice at the altar of Right-doing all
earthly goods; undergo chains, ignominy, dungeon-solitude,
pain, lingering hopelessness, and death? Who, then, would be
able to stand by, and see all these inflictions undergone by one
he loves best, when compliance with wrong-doing would surely
set the sufferer free? It is the certainty of an equal and
unrelenting law, which makes all kinds of endurance possible.</p>

<p>If no other reason existed, this one would suffice to prove
that, unless human nature is a falsehood, happiness must
ultimately coincide with virtue. How distantly removed their
final coincidence may be, is a point which can have no influence
on the certitude of our knowledge. We speak here, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
speak of parallel lines which cannot meet through infinity;&mdash;only
we speak the reverse way;&mdash;it is for all infinity that
virtue must become happiness. If a man will seriously sit
down, and try the contrary hypothesis out to himself, he will
see that if held true, Morality ceases to be imperial, and Man
ceases to be human. The claim of Right is to rule the
Universe, entire, and in every part. Before that claim, all
knowledge, scientific, phenomenal, inferential, must fail and
vanish away. Whatever else be true or untrue, this must be
rigorous, unalterable, imperishable truth. Upon this truth,
each reasonable being, percipient of it, is required to act in
his own individual person. Therefore, in the case of each
individual it must hold absolutely true. And thus the moral
endowment of Man is not a <em>general</em> sense of Morality; no
indeterminate impulse towards excellence floating before him;
no mere thought that past generations were made for us, and
we for a coming race. What we really know and acknowledge
as moral truth, is <em>each</em> Man's strict accountability,
individual, isolated, and inalienable. Otherwise, individual
rightness cannot be demanded, and individual suffering for
conscience-sake must become, in some eyes Utopian,&mdash;to most
sufferers intolerable. The moral law is therefore supreme, or
it would be ineffectual. It is individually specializing, otherwise
it could not claim individual obedience. And to be
supreme, both in final effect and present empire over each
human being, it must obviously be&mdash;(as our practical Reason
apprehends it)&mdash;Universal. To such a sovereignty there is
nothing great, nothing small. Time sets no bounds, while
Reason beholds in it the ultimate perfection and sum of all
that went before it.</p>

<p>Towards that complete coincidence of happiness with virtue,
the aspiration of good and the sighs of sorrowful souls, have
been breathed continually. In its realization alone, can our
noblest capabilities be realized. For, there is nothing in this
world commensurate with the capacious longings of the
human spirit. Here, too often, it droops like a beautiful
plant in a strange unkindly soil; and, when it blooms its
brightest, we feel that under other influences it might bloom
more brightly still. True humanity is marked by its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
specific character, as the fit inhabitant of a far more excellent
sphere.</p>

<p>We ask with some eagerness, how may these things be?
And the <em>primary</em> answer to this question lies within the
circuit of our knowledge. Our own consciousness, the facts
of life, and the reason of the thing, all agree in one result.
Moral law exists only in, and for, a Will; and by a Will alone
can it be made effectual. In this respect, it resembles the
Law of Production, which, apprehended ideally by intelligence,
becomes realized by the moving force of Will. Moreover, we
have seen that Will is true Causation, and therefore in Will
exists the first ground of Movement. We know in fact of
no other. Neither is any other Causality conceivable by us,
even in hypothesis; and we <em>think</em> this causative power of
Will only by knowing its real existence and verifying its
workings through their issues.</p>

<p>Yet further. The Moral Law, as a sovereign command, is
addressed to our Wills; and unless it were the Expression of
a Will, we know it could never be executed. The Law would
remain a dead letter,&mdash;a <em>thought</em> of Intelligence,&mdash;an abstract
speculation,&mdash;ineffective because impractical. Therefore, when
we speak of a Supreme Moral law, we speak of a Supreme
Moral Will; an idea we sometimes express by true Being,
or true Personality. We speak, that is, of God.</p>

<p>Experience deepens to us every day the meaning of this
final word. In the world of our present habitation, we see a
confused mass of striving Wills,&mdash;the good and just not always
in the ascendant,&mdash;rightful commands disregarded,&mdash;a sovereign
rule not visibly asserted. To affirm the possible continuance of
these practical contradictions, would be to deny the ultimate
Moral Unity of moral purposes. This Divine consummation
is, then, the finality towards which all things must in reason
be tending. For even as human nature explains all other
nature,&mdash;as the Moral Law explains all other law,&mdash;so God
explains Man. Explains his existence, otherwise inexplicable,
by the anticipated victory of Right over Wrong,&mdash;and the
complete satisfaction of his unsatisfied aspirations. By presenting,
that is to say, an adequate object,&mdash;a Personality
infinitely great and infinitely good,&mdash;to the eye of Man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
reason,&mdash;the desire of his heart,&mdash;the striving endeavour, and
ceaseless energy of Man's whole essential being;&mdash;his affections,
his will, his spirit.</p>

<p>This elevating thought comes home to each one of us, bringing
with it a peace of mind unutterable. We know that the time
must come, when thought and memory shall grow faint. Our
brain will lose its quick apprehensive motion, and all our
bodily powers must sink and languish. Our eyes will refuse
to see the faces of those we love; our hands to return their
kindly pressure; our nerves to thrill at their voices. But,
whosoever has learnt the lesson which God's world, and God's
gifts to Man, were meant to teach him, may truthfully say&mdash;"My
flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength of my
heart, and my portion for Ever."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Corollary.</i>&mdash;One reflection will probably have occurred to
every reader of the last few pages. The rigour of the moral
law demonstrates to us the necessary existence of a future
state of recompense, and the supremacy of a sovereign Will&mdash;a
divine Judge. Now, does not this very rigour leave man as
hopeless, as if he were altogether without God? Can he ever
expect to perform the behests of that pure and perfect Will?
This difficulty would appear valid, were there nothing in the
idea of God thus given us, to furnish rejoinders, such for example,
as the following.&mdash;How could the Supreme Judge make
any difference between those who are His anxious servants,
and those who turn away from His infinite purity with hatred
or indifference, if all men were alike overwhelmed in one common
failure by reason of an inexorable law? How, again,
could He satisfy the aspirations of earnest but half-hopeless
human souls, without gathering them to His presence and to
Himself? The manner in which such a happiness results to
men, may be an enigma, so far as Natural Theology is concerned;&mdash;but
if so, it is an enigma, of which, those who reason
on this ground, may foresee that there will certainly be granted
some solution. And we are not left quite in the dark as to
<em>how</em> that solution may be found;&mdash;a truth we may perceive
from the ensuing considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>The moral law is presented to Man's practical reason with
all its consequences. The divine Idea, when once apprehended,
becomes the object of Man's noblest affections. God, Who
graved His law of Right and Wrong upon the conscious will
of His creature, wrote also a law of love upon His creature's
human heart.</p>

<p>Hence we view the Supreme Being, as a God who formed
and endowed Man for Himself. It was thus, that Man's nature
received its only possible explanation. Hence, also, the sufficient
account of a capacity for happiness which this world
can never give;&mdash;and, along with it, the earnest of its ultimate
satisfaction.</p>

<p>But these evidences of the Divine finger, prove also a Divine
<em>intention</em>. The supreme ruler of the Universe has, by them,
written upon Man's nature a purpose of making His creature
happy. And if so, we cannot but conclude that to the Divine
attribute of love, which inspired the glad promise, we may
look for its certain fulfilment. In this point of view, a miracle
worked for such a moral and spiritual purpose as the ennoblement
and blessedness of Humanity, ceases in one sense to be
a miracle. It becomes not only credible, but probable. And
in reality, any event appears <em>less improbable</em> than that incredible
and most unlovely issue,&mdash;the self-contradictory
thought, that God has made Man in vain.</p>

<p>These considerations are drawn from our Moral nature, as
just described. There are other considerations at hand to
confirm them.</p>

<p>In treating the subject of Production, we saw Intelligence
involved in every Idea, and preceding every process. When
referred to the Universe, Intelligence was necessarily conceived
as vast and immeasurable. In order to discern the other
attributes of that universal Intelligence, we examined the
characteristics of Design apparent in nature, and saw everywhere
a spirit of superhuman tenderness breathed over our
beautiful world. Thus, if there be any personal relation
between the Author of Nature and our race, it ought to be
one of trust on our side, demanded by care and beneficence on
His. And this feeling is heightened by the charm of lavish
kindness,&mdash;the prodigality of a love Divine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, if we turn to one chapter of this Essay farther back,
and bring to mind the rise and progress of our primary beliefs,
we cannot but ask ourselves the question, how is it that the
first religious idea of the Aryan race&mdash;the "Heaven-father"&mdash;should
coincide with the most typical utterances of our
loveliest childhood, and our most advanced manhood, <em>now</em>?&mdash;Is
He really our Father? If so, may we not expect much
from His hand? He is a <em>Person</em>, not an Abstract Entity,&mdash;a
Force,&mdash;or a Thing. Our Father will give us, not a stone&mdash;but
bread;&mdash;bread from Heaven&mdash;bread from Himself. And
we see that He giveth liberally, and upbraideth not.</p>

<p>This is not all. The rigour of the Moral Law is an irreconcileable
Antithesis between Right and Wrong,&mdash;a gulf which
no human subtlety can bridge. But with all this rigour, it
leaves unresolved, to a very considerable extent, one set of
doubts perpetually recurring to an honest mind. Is <em>this</em> or
<em>that</em> particular point a duty;&mdash;is it right or wrong;&mdash;or is its
observance open to debate? There are obvious reasons, arising
from the necessities of moral culture and improvement, why
such points should, within certain limits, be indeterminate.
This whole topic, however, belongs properly to Natural Religion,
a separate subject from Natural Theology. Still, for our
present purpose, an important consequence of the inexactness
is clear.&mdash;It gives rise to a reasonable expectation of some
more extensive code not unlikely to be vouchsafed us, harmonizing
with, and supplementary to, the law of our moral
consciousness. And at every age of Man's history, and throughout
every country of his habitation, there always did, in
fact, prevail an expectant attitude of mind, looking on all sides
for the tokens of Divine Revelation. It was felt also by the
wisest, that no human foresight could decide beforehand,
what aids to higher knowledge and moral virtue might be
given along with it. Certainly, every reasonable idea of the

anticipation of the <em>Highest</em> and the <em>Best</em>.</p>

<p>This Essay has reached its close. May it be permitted its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
writer to drop the tone of an Essayist, and to say that every
word of it has come from his heart?</p>

<p>May he likewise ask two favours of the intelligent reader;
neither of them he trusts unreasonably onerous?</p>

<p>His first request is that the <em>convergent</em> effect of the separate
considerations urged in this Essay, may be fairly taken into
account. Indeed, the writer once thought of appending a
kind of conspectus or "summing up."&mdash;But he would thus
have added another full chapter to a book which has grown
considerably in his hands. Neither might the summary be
altogether welcome to the more candid minds amongst those
who doubt, yet honestly debate. Most such readers prefer
putting results and consilient reasonings into a connected
shape for themselves. The writer may however venture on
soliciting some special attention to the breadth of field ranged
over;&mdash;the wide circumference from which his various arguments
and illustrations have converged. This point is one of
considerable value. Great credit is given to the accordant
testimony of witnesses who have come together from distant
parts of the world.</p>

<p>The <em>other</em> favour requested, is that every person who desires
to form a deliberate judgment on the grand topics at issue,
will carefully weigh in the balance <em>what</em> alternative he can
embrace, if he refuses to be a Theist. An alternative, that is,
sufficient to account for the human Will and Reason, for such
a world as our own, and for so symmetrical and beautiful a
Universe.</p>

<p>The system we have advocated on grounds of Reason, asserts
that the first Cause of all Things and all Beings known to
us, is God. This account alone is sufficingly complete, and
coherent. Against it alone, no fatal objection has ever been
alleged. And this single fact ought to have a preponderating
weight in the balance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When finally compared together, the <em>motives</em> of our Choice
(as presented by Natural Theology), stand thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>If explanations of the Universe explain unequally, <em>that</em>
account ought to be chosen which is easiest in itself, explains
the most, and is the least self-contradictory.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>If several explanations appear equal to the deliberative eye,
then we must choose the noblest <i lang="la">per se</i>; and, as Men, we
ought to prefer that which is the most elevating, and most
germane to Humanity. In it, will be contained the only true
Law of human Progress.</p>

<p><em>Either</em> motive of our final Choice&mdash;still more, <em>both</em> these
motives&mdash;will bring us to God; and with reason&mdash;"For we are
also His offspring."</p>

In Coleridge's "Table Talk," for example, the subject of Man's distinguishing
prerogative of Immortality is discussed by the great speaker,
and his nephew's note of the discussion is headed "Materialism."
There appears, indeed, considerable difficulty in finding a precise expression
for the form of belief, or unbelief, commonly called Materialism.
Most people speak of it as of some clear and well-defined theory until
they begin seriously to investigate its <i>rationale</i>. Investigators are then
apt to become loud in their complaints of its inexactness. Take by
way of instance the following example. Speaking of "the doctrines of
Materialism," Lord Brougham remarks: "The vague and indistinct
form of the propositions in which they are conveyed affords one strong
argument against their truth. It is not easy to annex a definite meaning
to the proposition that mind is inseparably connected with a particular
arrangement of the particles of matter; it is more difficult to say what
they mean who call it a modification of matter; but to consider it as consisting
in a combination of matter, as coming into existence the instant
that the particles of matter assume a given arrangement, appears to be
a wholly unintelligible collocation of words."&mdash;(<cite>Discourse of Natural
Theology</cite>, p. 102).
</p>
<p>
Under such circumstances it may seem difficult for many a Materialist
to describe himself as the adherent of a distinct or closely reasoned
system. The main point we would submit for his earnest consideration
is the question whether his hypothesis lands him in certain subtle refinements
concerning the nature and connection of Force, Mind, and those
generalized facts which have been called the primary properties of Matter,&mdash;or
whether it leads him onward to the opinions described in the text.
Looking at the subject in this light, we might feel inclined to draw a
broad distinction between mere scientific Materialism and the Materialistic
doctrines of sceptical philosophy.</p></div>

doubt whether any such noxious crop has been gathered in such rank
abundance from the press of England in any former year of our literary
history as in this present year of our redemption, eighteen hundred and
seventy-two." The Premier had before remarked: "I believe that neither

<p><a name="Footnote_C_5" id="Footnote_C_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_5"><span class="label">[c]</span></a> Since writing the above, my attention has been called to Paley's
censure of the "disingenuous <em>form</em>" under which Scepticism was placed
before the public in his day. He says (<cite>Moral Philosophy</cite>, B. v. Sect. 9):
"Infidelity is served up in every shape that is likely to allure, surprise,
or beguile the imagination; in a fable, a tale, a novel, a poem; in interspersed
and broken hints, remote and oblique surmises; in books of
travels, of philosophy, of natural history; in a word, in any form rather
than the right one,&mdash;that of a professed and regular disquisition. And
because the coarse buffoonery and broad laugh of the old and rude adversaries
of the Christian faith would offend the taste, perhaps, rather than
the virtue of this cultivated age, a graver irony, a more skilful and delicate
banter, is substituted in their place."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_E_7" id="Footnote_E_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_7"><span class="label">[e]</span></a> Pre-eminent amongst these remonstrants is Mr. Gladstone. In
the speech before cited, he says, p. 25: "It is to be hoped that they will
cause a shock and a reaction, and will compel many, who may have too
lightly valued the inheritance so dearly bought for them, and may have
entered upon dangerous paths, to consider, while there is yet time,
whither those paths will lead them. In no part of his writings, perhaps,
has Strauss been so effective, as where he assails the inconsistency of those
who adopt his premises, but decline to follow him to their conclusions.
Suffice it to say, these opinions are by no means a merely German brood;
there are many writers of kindred sympathies in England, and some of as
outspoken courage." (Compare the extracts from this class of writers given
along with the Premier's remarks in Note <a href="#A.1">A</a>.)</p></div>

not content with persecuting the honest-minded humanitarian&mdash;when he
hears some shallow, half-animalized specimen of humanity shouting for a

<p><a name="Footnote_G_10" id="Footnote_G_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_10"><span class="label">[g]</span></a> I am indebted to Mr. Gladstone's appendix (p. 40) for the following
apposite quotations from Sir George Cornewall Lewis's very scarce work,
"On the Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion." Speaking of
"Authority, and its place not as an antagonist of Reason, but as an
instrument of Reason for the attainment of Truth," Sir George remarks,
in page 35 of his book: "'It is commonly said that the belief is independent
of the will,' and that no man can change it 'by merely wishing
it to be otherwise.' But 'the operation of a personal interest may cause
a man insensibly to adopt prejudices or partial and unexamined opinions.'
In page 38 he adds: 'Napoleon affords a striking instance of the corruption
of the judgment in consequence of the misdirection of the moral
sentiments.'"

<p>
All friends, and many casual readers, of S. T. Coleridge will remember
that he asserted the same, or perhaps a stronger, conclusion upon metaphysical
grounds, and with a force of language not easily surpassed.
This&mdash;one of Coleridge's bursts of gorgeous eloquence and imagery&mdash;will
be found in "The Friend," a book which, according to C. Lamb, contains
"his best talk." The subject commences on page 260 of Vol. III.,
Ed. 2, and page 211, seq., Vol. III., Ed. 4. In the latter place it is
amplified by a summary of his arguments, pages 213, 214. The position
propounded, that true insight cannot exist apart from moral rectitude,
receives considerable light from the doctrine of philosophical postulates
maintained in the "Biographia Literaria," Vol. I. c. 12, and chiefly borrowed
from Schelling, to whom there is an honest reference in the first
Edition, I. 250. I mention this circumstance because Coleridge has been
held guilty of unjustifiable pillage by writers who have noted his borrowing,
but omitted to observe such acknowledgments as he makes,
together with the additions and alterations which he introduces.

called a religious point of view, and we have animadverted upon Schopenhauer,
who loses no opportunity of flying in the face of this which is our Idea. As I
have said, such outbreaks impress our understanding as absurdities; to our
feelings, they are blasphemies. It appears to us rash and reckless, on the part of
a mere human individual, so boldly to set himself up against the All, out of which
he grows, and from which he has the morsel of intelligence that he misuses. We
see in this an abnegation of that feeling of dependence, which we admit to belong
to all men. We demand the same piety towards our Universum, as the devout
man of the old fashion did for his God."</p></div>

"Historisch genommen, d. h. die ungeheuren Wirkungen dieses Glaubens mit
seiner völligen Grundlosigkeit zusammengehalten, lässt sich die Geschichte von
der Auferstehung Jesu nur als ein weit historischer Humbug bezeichnen. Es
mag demüthigend sein für den menschlichen Stolz, aber es ist so; Jesus könnte
all das Wahre und Gute, auch all das Einseitige und Schroffe das ja doch auf die
Massen immer den stärksten Eindruck macht, gelehrt und im Leben bethätigt
haben; gleichwohl würden seine Lehren wie einzelne Blätter im Winde verweht
und zerstreut worden sein, wären diese Blätter nicht von dem Wahnglauben an
seine Auferstehung als von einem derben handfesten Einbände zusammengefasst

<p><a name="Footnote_9_19" id="Footnote_9_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_19"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> As a consequence of the difference in standpoint, the use made by the two
men of their several conclusions is marked by very considerable contrast. Comte's
Humanity was to be served by a ritual as well as a social set of ordinances. Strauss
looks quite another way. Considering the outrage which would be committed upon
philosophy and feeling should his Universum find irreverent treatment in the words
and writings of men; our emotion, he says, on such occasions becomes thoroughly
religious. If then it be asked in express terms whether he and his fellow-thinkers
really have a Religion or no, they cannot answer roundly as they will when questioned
on Christianity; they must rather say yes or no according to the meaning of
the word Religion in the mind of their questioner. (See Strauss, p. 143.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_10_20" id="Footnote_10_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_20"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> In the Livraison of the Deux Mondes for November, 1856, M. Cucheval-Clarigny
wrote thus: "Personne plus que David Hume n'a éprouvé l'inconstance
des jugemens humains. Après avoir été mis au rang des esprits qui ont fait le
plus d'honneur à l'humanité, on le compte volontiers aujourd'hui parmi les
corrupteurs de la raison et les apôtres du mal." That another kind of interest
has been more recently felt in Hume is evidenced by the republication of his
works in America and England. While writing this note I learn that a new
edition of the seldom-read Treatise on Human Nature will shortly appear, with
notes by two well-known members of Balliol College.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_21" id="Footnote_11_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_21"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Compare with this the subjoined orison for a special gift of moral rectitude
penned by Professor Huxley (Lay Sermons, p. 373). "I protest that if some
great power would agree to make me always think what is true and do what is
right, on condition of being turned into a sort of clock and wound up every
morning before I got out of bed, I should instantly close with the offer. The only
freedom I care about is the freedom to do right; the freedom to do wrong I am
ready to part with on the cheapest terms to any one who will take it of me." It
seems wonderful that the talented writer fails to perceive that should his terms
be granted the bargain would be dear indeed&mdash;it must take place at the expense
of his Personality. He would have no choice left, consequently no rightness of
choice. With the loss of his volition his manhood would be forfeited; and the
Huxley of our praise and blame must needs sink at once and for ever from a
Person to a Thing&mdash;

After all, we may trust that this outpouring of soul after mechanical goodness,
is neither more nor less than a fresh rehearsal of the popular fallacy or fable of a
learned and intelligent, but somewhat over-hasty, death-watch. The difference
between the two myths is not great, and both owe their existence to the prolific
fancy of Professor Huxley. About three years ago the teleological beetle speculated
in a manner which would have grieved the soul of Aldrich or Whately
respecting the purpose of a kitchen clock. The death-watch concluded, like a
death-watch, and not like a logician, that the clock's final end was to tick. Man,
as Bacon tells us, is the servant and interpreter of nature. Does any one feel
sure that a death-watch is the servant and interpreter of kitchen timepieces?
Yet his inconsequent thinking served as an implement of Fate to "quail, crush,
conclude, and quell" Teleology in general, and the Design argument for Natural
Theism in particular. <em>Now</em>, a human Huxley clock always going morally right
<em>because it must</em>, is equally conclusive against all freedom and all Conscience.
Equally conclusive, we know, because equally true to Nature and to Fact. As
conclusive as arguments against received biological tenets drawn from those great
natural curiosities the Gorgon, the dragon of St. George, and the fire-breathing
Chimæra, who united in her own fair person a lion, a dragon, and a goat. This
latter well-known phenomenon may seem nearly as striking as any right-minded
clock imaginable, and not much more incongruous.

<p>
Many readers may be reminded of Amurath's Ring. But few probably will
know, and fewer still recollect, Miss Edgeworth's clever comment upon it in
"Rosamond." The book is unfortunately scarce, not having been reprinted
along with "Early Lessons," therefore we add the extract ("Rosamond," vol. i.,
p. 148):&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Do you remember, brother," said Laura, "your wish when you were reading
that story in the 'Adventurer,' last week?"
</p>
<p>
"Not I. What wish?" said Godfrey. "What story?"
</p>
<p>
"Don't you remember," said Laura, "when you were reading the story of
Amurath and his ring, which always pressed his finger when he was going to do
anything wrong?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes; I wished to have such a ring," said Godfrey.
</p>
<p>
"Well, a friend is as good as such a ring," said Rosamond; "for a friend is, as
somebody observed, a <em>second conscience</em>; I may call Laura my <em>second conscience</em>."
</p>
<p>
"Mighty fine! but I don't like secondary conscience; a first conscience is, in
my opinion, a better thing," said Godfrey.
</p>
<p>
"You may have that too," said Rosamond.
</p>
<p>
"Too! but I'd rather have it alone," said Godfrey. "There is something so
cowardly in not daring to stand alone."
</p>
<p>
The lesson seems to be that second-hand goodness falls short of true goodness,
and that the impulse to moral action must arise from within&mdash;so unmanly is every
endeavour at shaking off, either by cowardice or by unreflectiveness, the human
burden and birthright of Responsibility.
</p>
<p>
Amurath's ring was a mechanical conscience. Professor Huxley's clock is a
mechanism in the outward form of a man. These two imaginations convey the
useful lessons that neither Conscience nor Mankind are mere machines. A clock
goes because it must go its hourly round; a man chooses which way, when, and
whither he will go.</p></div>

A reference very accessible to ordinary readers may be made to
Knight's English Cyclopædia, Article <cite>Nieuwentyt</cite>. "A work," says the
biographer, "was published by him at Amsterdam in 1715, in one volume
4to, entitled 'The right use of Contemplating the Works of the Creator':
the object of the author is first to convince atheists of the existence of a
supreme and benevolent Creator, by contemplating the mechanism of the
heavens, the structure of animals, etc.; and, secondly, to remove the
doubts of deists concerning revealed religion. It was originally published
in Dutch, but has passed through several editions, in German,
French, and English. The English editions, translated by Chamberlayne,
under the title of the 'Religious Philosopher,' appeared at London
in 1718-19 and 1730, in three vols. 8vo. This work, as was first pointed
out in the <cite>Athenæum</cite> for 1848, pp. 803, 907, 930, served as the basis for
Paley's 'Natural Theology,' the general argument and many of the illustrations
in that remarkable work being directly copied&mdash;and without the
slightest acknowledgment, though Paley was acquainted with the book&mdash;from
the 'Religious Philosopher.'"
</p>
<p>
Lord Brougham, who does not appear to have seen Bernard Nieuwentyt's
book, believes that Derham supplied the fountain from which Paley
drank so freely. Apparently he used both.
</p>
<p>
To this note it may be added that the want of Natural Philosophy
under which the Archdeacon himself laboured, has been recently commented
on in the following terms:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Paley kicked his foot unconcernedly against the stone he found on
the heath; for anything he knew, he says, it might have been there for
ever. Geology was then a practically unknown science, or he might have
found epochs of history in the stone, and evidence of all manner of
special creations for man's benefit. But Paley was no natural philosopher,
only a half-learned theologian, who skimmed over all difficulties,
and produced a book which has done immense harm in leading Englishmen
to anthropomorphic conceptions of God."&mdash;<cite>Report of an Address by

conclude that the country had in ancient times been cultivated by civilized

a very singular structure, the middle of each being traversed by a thin,

Curiously enough, the charge of Anthropomorphism has been brought
by a most eminent naturalist against the greatest authorities on Natural
Selection.
</p>
<p>
M. Edouard Claparède writes as follows in the "Archives des Sciences
Physiques et Naturelles" for 1870:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Mon but est seulement de montrer que les armes dont M. Wallace se
sert victorieusement pour attaquer le duc d'Argyll, se retournent contre
lui-même. Sans doute, c'est un pur anthropomorphisme que de supposer
chez un Créateur un sentiment du Beau entièrement semblable au nôtre,
et une telle hypothèse n'a rien à faire avec la science. Mais cet autre anthropomorphisme
par lequel les Darwinistes supposent chez les oiseaux
un sens du Beau identique au nôtre, est il plus justifié? Soit M. Darwin,
soit M. Wallace, expliquent la formation de la belle voix et du beau plumage
chez les oiseaux mâles par sélection sexuelle. Les femelles sont
censées donner toujours la préférence aux mâles, qui, au point de vue
humain, ont la plus belle voix et les plus brillantes couleurs. Au contraire,
chez toutes les espèces à cri désagrèable pour l'oreille humaine et
à couleur sombre, la nature du cri comme de la couleur a dû sa formation
à une autre forme de sélection que la sélection sexuelle. Quel oubli de
l'antique dicton: <i lang="la">De gustibus et coloribus non est disputandum</i>! Si ce dicton
a été reconnu vrai chez toutes les nations civilisées, il acquiert une
force bien autrement grande lorsqu'il s'agit de son application à des
oiseaux. Serait il absurde de supposer chez certains oiseaux un goût prononcé
pour les couleurs sombres, comme ce goût existe chez beaucoup
d'hommes? Et alors ne devient-il pas possible, contrairement à MM.
Darwin et Wallace, d'expliquer la couleur terne de certaines espèces par
sélection sexuelle? N'en peut-il pas être de même pour la voix criarde
de tel ou tel volatile? Certes, il est dangereux de baser un édifice sur
quelque chose d'aussi subjectif qu'un sentiment, quelque soit du reste la
nature de l'être chez lequel on le suppose plus ou moins gratuitement,
oiseau ou Créateur!" (pp. 175-6.)</p></div>

A similar Dualism (coupled with the charge of Anthropomorphism) is
frequently urged against Natural Theology at the present day. The alternative
proposed has been called Monism. The fixed unyielding realm
of Abiology (inorganic nature) is taken as the type of the universe. The
sole supposable Divine principle (or Spirit) is identified with its law,
which is in turn pronounced identical with philosophical necessity&mdash;that
is to say, a necessity not imposed by or flowing from the Divine will, but
a necessity which annihilates the possibility of all will. The Divine principle
thus supposed is simply that law or force which is embodied in the
mechanism of the universe.

Professor Haeckel of Jena is the author of a book which has been
styled in Germany, "The Bible of Darwinism." The following passages
will show how he treats the subject under consideration in the text. He
writes (Generelle Morphologie der Organismen, Book II. cap. vi. sec. 2,
"On Creation") to the following effect:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">The conception of Creation</span> is either altogether unimaginable, or
at least perfectly inconsistent with that pure intuition of Nature founded
on an empirical basis. In Abiology a creation is no longer anywhere
spoken of at all, and it is in Biology only that people are still closely
wrapped up in this error. The conception of creation is perfectly unimaginable,
if by it is understood 'an origination of something out of nothing.'
This acceptation is quite incompatible with one of the first and chiefest
of Nature's laws&mdash;one, indeed, universally acknowledged&mdash;namely, with
the great law, that <span class="smcap">ALL MATTER IS ETERNAL</span>." (Vol. i. p. 171.)
</p>
<p>
There is one general reflection which may fairly strike the
honest and ingenuous mind respecting the difficulties thus
"Now if the conception of such an immaterial force, discoverable
exterior to matter, independent of, yet nevertheless acting upon it, is
absolutely inadmissible and inconceivable in itself, then so, too, becomes
the conception of a creative power from our point of view; and all the
more so, since with it are united the most untenable teleological conceptions,
and the most palpable Anthropomorphism." ... "In all
these teleological conceptions, and similarly in all histories of creation
which the poetical phantasy of men has produced, gross Anthropomorphism
is so evident, that we may leave the denial of this Creation-idea to
the insight of any general reader who thinks for himself, and is not too far
involved in traditional prejudices." ... "A creation of organisms
is, therefore, partly quite unimaginable, partly in such complete contradiction
to all knowledge of nature empirically gained, that we cannot in any
case allow ourselves to end by accepting this hypothesis. There remains,
consequently, nothing else but to suppose a spontaneous origination of the
simplest organisms, from which all more perfect ones developed themselves
by gradual metamorphosis&mdash;that is to say, a self-forming or self-configuration
of matter into organization, which is generally called primordial
production or spontaneous generation (<i lang="la">generatio æquivoca</i>). (Ibid. 173-4.)
</p>
<p>
Haeckel commences his section upon Dualism and Monism (Book I. cap.
iv. section 6), with the following quotation from August Schleicher (die
Darwinische Theorie und die Sprachwissenschaft: Weimar, 1863, p. 8):&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The tendency of modern thought is undeniably towards <em>Monism</em>.
<em>Dualism</em>&mdash;whether you are pleased to define it as the contrast of spirit
and nature, of contents and form, of appearance and reality&mdash;is no longer
a firm ground to stand upon, if we wish to survey the field of modern
science. To the latter there is no matter without spirit (<i>i.e.</i> without the
unavoidable necessity that governs it), nor, on the other hand, is there
any spirit without matter. We might say, perhaps, that there is neither
matter nor spirit in the usual acceptation of the words, but only a something
which is the one and the other at the same time. To charge this
view&mdash;which is founded on observation&mdash;with materialism, is equally
unjust as to lay it at the door of spiritualism."
</p>
<p>
Haeckel concludes this section by avowing an unalterable conviction of
the truth of Monism, with which his mind is thoroughly penetrated.

whose practice it is to speak of any incidental chasm occasioned by the
link sometimes missing from his premises, as "not a long step." "Mr.
Darwin's argument," says a reviewer of his "Descent of Man," "is a continuous
conjugation of the potential mood. It rings the changes on 'can
have been,' 'might have been,' 'would have been,' 'should have been,'
until it leaps with a wide bound into 'must have been.'" (<cite>Times</cite>, April
8, 1871.) Any similarity between the reasonings of the Archdeacon and
the Naturalist may appear noteworthy. But the coincidence ends here.

proper meaning to terms used in senses so technical. He may possibly
be assisted by looking over the field of view thus:&mdash;A Force is visible to
us as a movement in Nature;&mdash;when we try to formulate it intelligently
to ourselves, its mental equivalent is Law. If, then, we wish to describe
an intelligent præ-conception of Law (such as distinctly involves the Foresight
of its operation) we call the Law a Creative Idea, or (less definitely)
a Design. Tracing the chain of causation in the reverse or downward
direction, the Idea when put in movement appears to our mind's eye as
Law; and when we wish to include its actual working upon the realm
of Nature we term it a Force.
</p>
<p>
Both James Mill and his son (a truly affectionate annotator), are careful
to point out that the essence of moral causation involves Intention&mdash;that
is (as Mr. Mill explains), Foresight, or expectation of consequences.&mdash;"Analysis
of the Human Mind," II., 400, 401.
</p>
<p>
It should be observed that in many branches of Natural Science the
word Law is so employed as to include the conception of Force. Law
is in this usage not merely a logical formula expressive of realized facts,
but it involves the idea of the coercion or impellent motion which
brought those facts into being. "Thus, then," says Dr. Carpenter,
"whilst no Law, which is simply <em>a generalisation of phenomena</em>, can be
considered as having any <em>coercive</em> action, we may assign that value to
Laws which express <em>the universal conditions of the action of a Force</em>, the
existence of which we learn from the testimony of our own consciousness."
He had before remarked that "it is the substitution of the Dynamical
for the mere Phenomenal idea, which gives their highest value to
our conceptions of the Order of Nature."&mdash;<em>Address to British Association
at Brighton, August, 1872.</em> This <em>Order</em> of Nature, as the learned
President says in conclusion, is no "sufficient account of its <em>Cause</em>."</p></div>

of ingenious methods in which a world could be constructed; and I have
no doubt that had any of the philosophers above quoted the use of a
good manageable comet, and the philosophical warehouse, <em>chaos</em>, at his

you will take his word for it, better than this we inhabit." Such is the

be most readily explained by a similitude. Let the physical series of
antecedents and consequents be represented by a chain of which we see
the present links, but both its beginning and its end are invisible. Physical
law is this chain. Cause must not be considered its first link, for
Cause differs in <em>kind</em> from the series, is in truth <em>sui generis</em>, and can be
illustrated by no physical phenomenon, but by the fact of our own Moral
Volition. Cause, therefore, is external to the chain, and originates, not
only the first, but every link of it. Each and all&mdash;nay, the universal
chain in its entirety&mdash;may be viewed as owing its existence to one single
fiat of an absolute moral Cause. Compare on this subject Chapters VI.

after an immediate intuition of power, or to seek for it in <em>mind as determining

of power or causality is thus to be found in my consciousness of
<em>myself as willing</em>. In every act of volition, I am fully conscious that it is
in my power to form the resolution or to abstain; and this constitutes
the presentative consciousness of free-will and of power. Like any other
simple idea, it cannot be defined; and hence the difficulty of verbally
distinguishing causation from mere succession. But every man who has

extension of the argument from Design. "He that planted the ear,
shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, shall He not see?...
He that teacheth man knowledge, <em>shall not He know?</em>" In other words,
if we may argue from the structure of the eye and ear to an Intelligence
which comprehends our sense-perceptions, their conditions, and their
activities, may we not always argue from the reason of man to an Intelligence
comprehending our highest human endowments?
</p>
<p>
If so, we reflect these attributes back upon our explanation of the
natural world. We say, further, that such a Creator would never make
a mere <em>machine</em>. Humanity was a necessary complement of all that is
set under Man. And thus Francis Bacon's aphorism may be applied in a
double sense,&mdash;Man not only interprets Nature to himself&mdash;but he affords
in himself a text for her more complete interpretation. Nature and

<p><a name="Footnote_41_60" id="Footnote_41_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_60"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> As regards another important word illustrated in this chapter, it may
be useful to add that the term Analogy is often employed in a wide or
rather vague signification; not only by careless writers, but by philosophers.
There is an important passage in Bacon's Plan of the Instauratio
(prefixed to the Novum Organon) which Wood translates thus:&mdash;"The
testimony and information of the senses bears always a relation to
man, and not to the universe, and it is altogether a great mistake to
assert that our senses are the measure of things.
</p>
<p>
The Latin original for "bears a relation" is "est ex analogiâ," but Mr.
Ellis prefers rendering it by "has reference to," and confirms his decision
by comparing two other Latin phrases;&mdash;one, "Materia non est cognoscibilis
nisi <i lang="la">ex analogiâ</i> formæ"&mdash;the other, "Materia non est scibilis nisi
<i lang="la">in ordine</i> ad formam;&mdash;ut dicit" (adds Thomas Aquinas) "Philosophus
in primo Physicorum." Mr. Ellis subjoins "That the meaning of the
word Analogy was misconceived by S. Thomas, by Duns Scotus, and by
the schoolmen in general, is pointed out by Zabarella, <cite>De prim. rerum
materiâ</cite>, I. 4."
</p>
<p>
"Philosophus" means Aristotle, who, however, in the passage referred
to is faithful to his own correct definition of Analogy, and his instance
may readily be stated in four terms, as will appear on reference to the
passage (Ed. Bekker 191, a. 8). Argyropylus translates by "similitudine
rationis," and St. Hilaire explains "analogia" for the benefit of
the general reader by "rapport proportionnel"&mdash;(Leçons de Physique
I. 8, s. 18).
</p>
<p>
That Bacon was really thus vague in his use of "ex analogiâ" may be
gathered from his substitution of "in ordine ad" as an equivalent in the
closely related passage, Nov. Org. II. 20. Such being the case with so
great a writer, some little allowance may be made for difference of phrase
employed by ordinary reasoners on Natural Theology.</p></div>

It seems also founded in the nature of things. That real science tends to ground
itself, strives after unification with kindred sciences, and, by so doing, rises into
philosophy, is a fact visible in every line and letter of Faraday; and the general
reader will find it exemplified throughout many fascinating pages of Dr. Tyndall's
<cite>Fragments of Science for Unscientific People</cite>, particularly in his articles on Vitality,
the use of the Imagination, and the life of Faraday, not to mention his own book
on the great inductive philosopher.</p></div>

intellect. The former flowered in the Stuart men and in David Hume. The latter
produced such diversely graven characters as Sir William Hamilton and Mr.
Carlyle. Hume's natural acuteness received a subtle refinement from his Jesuit
educators at La Flêche. But his intellectual bent and determination was given by
the French parlour-philosophy, which heralded Rousseau and Robespierre. Hume's
well-known face is a truthful index to his mind. If compared with Kant's, the
lesson is obvious to even an unskilled physiognomist. Self-complacency beams
over every feature.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_47_66" id="Footnote_47_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_66"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> No doubt the actual course of Hume's philosophising was determined by his
zeal against everything he deemed superstitious. It was this dominant motive
which made him less a calm philosopher than a skilful advocate, and laid him open
to the influences of the French Deism of his period. How strong the tendency
was we may infer from the following anecdote, which occurs in an account of his
declining days by his friend and admirer, Dr. Adam Smith (pp. 47-50):&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Hume had been "reading a few days before, Lucian's Dialogues of the Dead:
among all the excuses which are alleged to Charon for not entering readily into his
boat, he could not find one that fitted him. He then diverted himself with inventing
several jocular excuses, which he supposed he might make to Charon, and
with imagining the very surly answers which it might suit the character of Charon
to return to them. 'Upon further consideration,' said he, 'I thought I might say
to him, Good Charon, I have been correcting my works for a new edition. Allow
me a little time that I may see how the Public receives the alterations.' But
Charon would answer, 'When you have seen the effect of these, you will be for
making other alterations. There will be no end of such excuses; so, honest friend,
please step into the boat.' But I might still urge, 'Have a little patience, good
Charon; I have been endeavouring to open the eyes of the Public. If I live a few
years longer, I may have the satisfaction of seeing the downfall of some of the
prevailing systems of superstition.' But Charon would then lose all temper and
decency. 'You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years.
Do you fancy I will grant you a lease for so long a term? Get into the boat this
instant, you lazy loitering rogue!'"</p></div>

and axioms which are promiscuous and indifferent to several Sciences;" in part
"of the inquiry touching the operation of the relative and adventitious conditions
of Essences, as quantity, similitude, diversity, possibility, and the rest." These
he terms "Transcendentals," and they form a highest kind of philosophical arrangements,
"with this distinction and provision, that they be handled as they have
efficiency in Nature and not logically."
</p>
<p>
His instances of common principles show how very vaguely this idea of the first
division floated before his mind. Some of them are axioms mathematically certain
and true in more than one province of philosophy, others are generalized truths
obtained by experience or by comparison of objects diverse in appearance, but to his
mind identical or very similar. Among these latter occurs his celebrated saying, that
"the delight of the quavering upon a stop in music is the same with the playing of
light upon the water";&mdash;a thought that haunts us by the seaside and on the shore
of mountain lakes while listening to some sweet voice or clear-toned instrument.
</p>
<p>
From his philosophical arrangements Bacon takes away inquiries into the One,
the Good, and the Divine, and assigns them to Natural Theology.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_63_82" id="Footnote_63_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_82"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> In a volume of philosophical Romance some unknown Gulliver of the 19th
century bestows many pages of pleasant satire on the Utilitarian principle, assumed
as a maxim of social life and pushed to its ultimate conclusions. The author
travels into the country of Nowhere (Erewhon), and learns by personal experience,
first in a prison, and next in the house of a princely swindler Senoj Nosnibor (<i>alias</i>
Jones Robinson) those true laws of Sociology which best subserve the great final
end&mdash;the noble object laid down by Mr. Mill. Ill-health is made criminal. Immorality
counts as being out of sorts. The former is an object of penal justice,
the latter of condolence joined with alterative discipline. The swindler sends for
his family "straightener," and gets well amidst the sympathy of his friends; the
consumptive is condemned to imprisonment and hard labour for the rest of his
miserable days. And this is reasonable in itself, and justified by the results,&mdash;the
Erewhonians possess the finest physique in the world, and rob and embezzle only
when they happen to feel tempted. Our traveller himself, though full of old-fashioned
moral prejudices, becomes convinced by contemplating the great final
cause. "That dislike," he observes, "and even disgust should be felt by the fortunate
for the unfortunate, or at any rate for those who have been discovered to
have met with any of the more serious and less familiar misfortunes, is not only
natural, but desirable for any society, whether of man or brute: what progress
either of body or soul had been otherwise possible?"&mdash;and again, "I write with
great diffidence, but it seems to me that there is no unfairness in punishing people
for their misfortunes or rewarding them for their sheer good luck: it is the normal
condition of human life that this should be done, and no right-minded person will
complain at being subjected to the common treatment. There is no alternative
open to us. It is idle to say that men are not responsible for their misfortunes.
What is responsibility? Surely to be responsible means to be liable to have to give
an answer should it be demanded, and all things which live are responsible for their
lives and actions, should society see fit to question them through the mouth of its
authorised agent. What is the offence of a lamb that we should rear it, and tend
it, and lull it into security, for the express purpose of killing it? Its offence is the
misfortune of being something which society wants to eat, and which cannot
defend itself. This is ample. Who shall limit the right of society except society
itself? And what consideration for the individual is tolerable unless society be the
gainer thereby?" Erewhon, pp. 85, 86, and 100, 101.
</p>
<p>
These sentiments considered, the reader will not be surprised to learn that our
author, after a preparatory college training in the main doctrines of Self-interest&mdash;to
wit, Evasion and Inconsistency&mdash;ends happily and usefully for himself by the
successful abduction of his host's daughter&mdash;and by advertising a propaganda of
certain European manners and observances unknown in Erewhon, to be carried out
by kidnapping its healthy inhabitants and training them properly on our sugar
plantations. What genuine disciple of Utilitarianism can conceive a brighter
moral triumph than the union of private self-interest with the interested aims of
a great sugar-growing people? Matter-of-fact Baconians may argue that Utility
substitutes a misplaced and one-sided "why" for the "what" required by
Moralists,&mdash;but our traveller's answer is plain&mdash;he argues on <i>data</i>;&mdash;given the premises&mdash;his
is the inevitable conclusion. The defence of the former will be an
interest to plenty of people&mdash;philosophic and unphilosophic. Leave the data to
them; or if necessary make a further appeal to the religious aims of society. In
Erewhon the great feminine Divinity Ydgrun is supreme; she is sovereign
amongst ourselves also;&mdash;only we twist her name and call the Goddess "Grundy."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_71_90" id="Footnote_71_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_90"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> Dans plusieurs passages de ses écrits, quand il insiste avec le plus de force sur
l'impossibilité où est la raison humaine d'atteindre à la certitude, il semble tout
près d'accepter la révélation divine comme source de certaines grandes verités que
nous ne saurions repousser, quoiqu'il ne nous soit pas possible de les démontrer.
Un soir qu'à Paris il soupait chez le baron d'Holbach, on vint à parler de la religion
naturelle; Hume déclara que pour sa part il n'avait jamais rencontré d'athée. On
sait la réponse de son hôte. "Parbleu, vous avez de la chance; pour la première
fois vous en rencontrez dix-sept du même coup." Hume ne demanda point à être
compté comme le dix-huitième. Dix ans auparavant, il se trouvait à Londres
lorsque lui arriva la nouvelle de la mort de sa mère; son ami Boyle, frère du comte
de Glasgow, témoin de la douleur profonde où le jeta cette perte, exprima le regret
qu'il ne pût trouver de consolation dans les croyances chrétiennes sur la destinée
des justes et sur la vie future. "Ah! mon ami," dit Hume en sanglotant, "je peux
bien publier mes spéculations pour occuper les savans et les métaphysiciens; mais
ne croyez pas que je sois si loin que vous le supposez de penser comme le reste des
hommes." <cite>Deux Mondes</cite>, 1856, Vol. VI., pp. 118, 19. The latter anecdote will be
found in <cite>Burton</cite> at rather greater length. Vol. I. 293, 4.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72_91" id="Footnote_72_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_91"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> These Dialogues were posthumously published in obedience to their author's
will. Hume had kept the MS. by him for twenty-seven years, and had corrected
it from time to time, yet had delayed publication from deference to the judgment
of his friends. He directed his literary executor, Adam Smith, to publish the
Dialogues within two years of his death; but, in consequence of Smith's distaste
for the task, this duty devolved upon Hume's nephew. They were printed in 1779
translated into German in 1781, and commented on by Jacobi in 1787.
</p>
<p>
Lowndes states that these Dialogues were not republished with the "Essays,"
but is mistaken in saying so. They appear at the end of Vol. II. in the 8vo. Edition
of 1788. As this is not an uncommon or expensive book, I quote its paging.
The quantity of matter extends only through 113 8vo. pages, and reference will
not be difficult in any other Edition.
</p>
<p>
It seems true that the Dialogues were withdrawn from later reprints of the
Essays. They appear to have been considered particularly objectionable; but there
is no doubt that they express Hume's most deliberate and matured convictions,
and thus become to fair inquirers particularly valuable. It must, however, be
added that Hume valued himself on a conservatism of opinion. Comparing, when
forty years old, his recent Essays with his Treatise "planned before I was twenty-one
and composed before twenty-five," he says, "The philosophical principles are
the same in both; but I was carried away by the heat of youth and invention to
publish too precipitately." <cite>Burton</cite>, I. 337.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_73_92" id="Footnote_73_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_92"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> There can be no doubt that Cleanthes is meant for the representative man,
both from the tenor of the Dialogue itself and from a letter to Sir Gilbert Elliot,
of Minto, given by <i>Burton</i>, I. 331-6. The following extracts may be acceptable
to the reader:&mdash;"You would perceive by the sample I have given you, that I make
Cleanthes the hero of the dialogue: whatever you can think of, to strengthen
that side of the argument, will be most acceptable to me. Any propensity you
imagine I have to the other side, crept in upon me against my will; and 'tis not
long ago that I burned an old manuscript book, wrote before I was twenty, which
contained, page after page, the gradual progress of my thoughts on that head. It
began with an anxious search after arguments, to confirm the common opinion;
doubts stole in, dissipated, returned; were again dissipated, returned again; and
it was a perpetual struggle of a restless imagination against inclination, perhaps
against reason.... I could wish Cleanthes' argument could be so analyzed,
as to be rendered quite formal and regular. The propensity of the mind towards
it,&mdash;unless that propensity were as strong and universal as that to believe in our
senses and experience,&mdash;will still, I am afraid, be esteemed a suspicious foundation.
'Tis here I wish for your assistance; we must endeavour to prove that this propensity
is somewhat different from our inclination to find our own figures in the
clouds, our faces in the moon, our passions and sentiments even in inanimate
matter. Such an inclination may, and ought to be controlled, and can never be a
legitimate ground of assent.
</p>
<p>
"The instances I have chosen for Cleanthes are, I hope, tolerably happy, and the
confusion in which I represent the sceptic seems natural, but&mdash;si quid novisti
rectius, etc.... He (Cleanthes) allows, indeed, in part 2nd, that all our
inference is founded on the similitude of the works of nature to the usual effects
of mind, otherwise they must appear a mere chaos. The only difficulty is, why
the other assimilations do not weaken the argument; and indeed it would seem
from experience and feeling, that they do not weaken it so much as we might
naturally expect."
</p>
<p>
It seems clear on the whole, that, so far as <em>Physico-Theology</em> went, Hume was
not ill qualified for a Natural Theologian. All the more so perhaps, because, while
seeing the difficulties which attach themselves to this kind of argument, he pronounced
it to hold conclusively at last.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74_93" id="Footnote_74_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_93"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> The following quotation is from the <cite>Treatise</cite> "composed before twenty-five":&mdash;"Nor
does this reasoning only prove, that morality consists not in any relations,
that are the objects of science; but if examined, will prove with equal certainty,
that it consists not in any <em>matter of fact</em>, which can be discovered by the understanding.
This is the <em>second</em> part of our argument; and if it can be made
evident, we may conclude, that morality is not an object of reason. But can
there be any difficulty in proving, that vice and virtue are not matters of fact,
whose existence we can infer by reason?... So that when you pronounce
any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing, but that from the constitution
of your nature you have a feeling or sentiment of blame from the
contemplation of it. Vice and virtue, therefore, may be compared to sounds,
colours, heat and cold, which, according to modern philosophy, are not qualities
in objects, but perceptions in the mind: and this discovery in morals, like that
other in physics, is to be regarded as a considerable advancement of the speculative
sciences; though, like that too, it has little or no influence on practice."
<cite>Treatise</cite>, Book III., part 1, Vol. II., 170, 1.
</p>
<p>
This 3rd Book of the <cite>Treatise</cite> was not printed till Hume was in his 30th year;
and he felt some hesitation respecting the latter paragraph. "Is not this," he
asks Hutcheson, "laid a little too strong? I desire your opinion of it, though
I cannot entirely promise to conform myself to it. I wish from my heart I could
avoid concluding, that since morality, according to your opinion, as well as mine,
is determined merely by sentiment, it regards only human nature and human
life.... If morality were determined by reason, that is the same to all
rational beings; but nothing but experience can assure us that the sentiments are
the same. What experience have we with regard to superior beings? How can
we ascribe to them any sentiments at all? They have implanted those sentiments
in us for the conduct of life like our bodily sensations, which they possess not
themselves." (<cite>Burton</cite>, I. 119.) The paragraph was, however, published; and
helped by consequence to foster in its author's mind that Utilitarian theory of
morals respecting which many late writers have been only Hume's copyists. In
this very <cite>Treatise</cite> he did in fact apply that theory to the most important of
Social questions (see same Bk., Pt. II. Sec. 12, more especially p. 299), and was
thus led into lax conclusions respecting those bonds between Man and Woman
which underlie the other foundations of Society. Hume shares this blame with
his disciples; for leading Utilitarians are apt to shew by their own domestic
relations that the principle, <em>when applied</em>, results in maxims lower than our present
English tone of thought upon this subject.
</p>
<p>
But let us suppose that Hume had lived to analyze Rousseau's Confessions.
Would he not have urged with the force of truth, that to animalize a Man is to
destroy his Manhood, to weaken his judgment and impair his Moral sense?
Would he not have argued from Rousseau the depraved boy, to Rousseau the shop-man
and footman, and pointed out that in such cases Truth, Honesty, and
Gratitude become mere names and shadows?&mdash;No one could have replied that
Hume was wrong in fact and experience, but some might have said that <em>all</em> which
lowers the supremacy of the Moral sense lowers the Manhood of Man. As Hume
admitted the fact of a Moral sense, he might possibly have felt the cogency of
this argument.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_75_94" id="Footnote_75_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_94"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> No one who reads Hume's account of his own motives on various occasions
will think it untrue to say that his judgment was largely influenced by his vanity.
Compare for example his well-known letter to Dr. Blair of December 20th, 1765,
with another to the same, dated 1st July, 1766;&mdash;the first a panegyric on the
"celebrated Rousseau," the second a fierce invective against that "blackest and
most atrocious villain." Who can help seeing that the motives of the eulogy are
derived from a series of self-gratulations;&mdash;while the cause of the invective is a
sharp wound given to the philosopher's self-love?</p></div>

case: "As the universe shows wisdom and goodness, we infer wisdom and goodness.

degree of them, precisely adapted to the effect which we examine. But farther
attributes or farther degrees of the same attributes, we can never be authorized
to infer or suppose, by any rules of just reasoning." The argument of this section
upon which Hume's limitations are based, is put into the mouth of a representative
Epicurus; it is acute even to extreme subtlety, but it is also suicidal. The
restraints applied to what he explains as the argument from effects to cause, and
conversely down again from cause to other effects, cannot be maintained without
dealing a death blow at the Inductive Philosophy. How little do we know of
the material Universe, yet we apply the principle of gravitation to the Whole,
seen and unseen. By its aid we find masses of radiant matter previously unknown,
and predict events long before they are phenomenally apparent. The vast power
of <em>extending</em> knowledge which the Inductive principle asserts, will occur for our
investigation in Chapter IV. Another Epicurean position contained in this same
Section XI. has been quoted in a previous note, together with Hume's own reply
to it; see pp. 101, 2 <i>ante</i>.

A criticism of Hume's Tenth and Eleventh sections occupies a long note
appended by Lord Brougham to his "Discourse on Natural Theology"&mdash;a volume
I suppose accessible to almost all students of the science.</p></div>

Beginning;&mdash;the idea that is of a law-governed <i lang="la">materies mundi</i>, a substantial force,
and movement evoked into primary Existence.
</p>
<p>
The prospect of final change yet to be, is thus similarly connected by a living
philosopher (Helmholtz) with the history of our world's Past:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"We estimate the duration of human History at 6,000 years; but immeasurable
as this time may appear to us, what is it in comparison with the time during
which the earth carried successive series of rank plants and mighty animals, and
no men; during which in our neighbourhood the amber-tree bloomed, and dropped
its costly gum on the earth and in the sea; when in Siberia, Europe, and North
America groves of tropical palms flourished; where gigantic lizards, and after them
elephants, whose mighty remains we still find buried in the earth, found a home?
Different geologists, proceeding from different premises, have sought to estimate
the duration of the above-named creative period, and vary from a million to nine
million years.&mdash;&mdash;The time during which the earth generated organic beings is
again small when compared with the ages during which the world was a ball of fused
rocks. For the duration of its cooling from 2,000° to 200° Centigrade the experiments
of Bishop upon basalt show that about 350 millions of years would be necessary.&mdash;&mdash;And
with regard to the time during which the first nebulous mass condensed
into our planetary system, our most daring conjectures must cease. The
history of man, therefore, is but a short ripple in the ocean of time.&mdash;&mdash;For a much
longer series of years than that during which he has already occupied this world,
the existence of the present state of inorganic nature favourable to the duration of
man seems to be secured, so that for ourselves and for long generations after us
we have nothing to fear. But the same forces of air and water, and of the
volcanic interior, which produced former geological revolutions, and buried one
series of living forms after another, act still upon the earth's crust. They more
probably will bring about the last day of the human race than those distant
cosmical alterations of which we have spoken, forcing us perhaps to make way for
new and more complete living forms, as the lizards and the mammoth have given
place to us and our fellow-creatures which now exist.
</p>
<p>
"Thus the thread which was spun in darkness by those who sought a perpetual
motion has conducted us to a universal law of nature, which radiates light into the
distant nights of the beginning and of the end of the history of the universe. To
our own race it permits a long but not an endless existence; it threatens it with
a day of judgment, the dawn of which is still happily obscured. As each of us
singly must endure the thought of his death, the race must endure the same.
But above the forms of life gone by, the human race has higher moral problems
before it, the bearer of which it is, and in the completion of which it fulfils its
destiny." Helmholtz, <cite>Popular Lectures on Scientific Subjects</cite>, p. 191, seq.
</p>
<p>
The distinguished German had just before observed, "Even though the force
store of our planetary system is so immensely great ... still the inexorable
laws of mechanics indicate that this store of force, which can only suffer loss
and not gain, must be finally exhausted." On the subject of such vast cosmical
changes, the reader may like to peruse the remarks of <i lang="fr">Littré</i> in his most recent
volume&mdash;"Les choses, ou, pour mieux dire, nos choses sont d'hier, dût cet hier
comporter de prodigieuses durées.
</p>
<p>
"Cette nouveauté est un témoignage que notre monde, notre univers, auront
une fin. Ce qui a commencé doit finir, la raison le dit, et toutes nos connaissances
physiques le confirment. Le soleil et les étoiles se refroidissent incessamment,
versant dans les espaces une chaleur qui ne leur revient jamais. Quelque chauds
qu'ils soient, ils le sont chaque jour un peu moins, le calorique s'y épuisera; ils
s'éteindront, comme déjà leurs planètes se sont éteintes. Que deviendront ces
masses animées d'un mouvement rapide? Nul ne peut le dire. Mais il suffirait
d'un choc entre elles pour y transformer un prodigieux mouvement en une prodigieuse
incandescence, et y renouveler un cycle de chaleur et d'expansion.
</p>
<p>
"Ce serait se perdre en vaines et gratuites hypothèses, que de spéculer sur ce
que deviendra notre univers quand il aura pris fin, comme de spéculer sur ce qu'il
fut avant qu'il eût pris commencement." Littré, <cite>La Science</cite>, pp. 560, 1.
</p>
<p>
There are thinkers who believe that these cycles, immeasurable to Man, took
their governing laws from a supreme Designer. They will be aided by Helmholtz
and Littré in shaping their ideas of His far-reaching wisdom and power. There
are also thinkers who find within their own inward Being a consciousness of kinship
with the Source of Causation, so infinitely beyond cycles apparently infinite. How
great then the value of human Spirits bearing His likeness, and with it a promise of
surviving the period when our world's cycles shall vanish away in Space&mdash;to be
replaced by other hereditary cycles, or to be remembered no more for ever!</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_88_107" id="Footnote_88_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88_107"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> Professor Max Müller writes as follows.&mdash;"If philosophy has to
explain what is, not what ought to be, there will be and can be no rest
till we admit, what cannot be denied, that there is in man a (third)
faculty, which I call simply the faculty of apprehending the Infinite, not
only in religion, but in all things; a power independent of sense and
reason, a power in a certain sense contradicted by sense and reason, but
yet a very real power, which has held its own from the beginning of the
world, neither sense nor reason being able to overcome it, while it alone
is able to overcome both reason and sense." <cite>Max Muller's Lectures on
the Science of Religion</cite>.&mdash;Lect. I. New Ed. p. 20. The use of the word
faculty is defended in a note.
</p>
<p>
I quote this passage with pleasure, because one main objection brought
against the possible existence of such a faculty is taken from the <em>negative
form</em> of the word Infinite. The Professor maintains that, as a question
of Philology, Infinite signifies an affirmative idea. In his Lectures on
Language, second series, p. 576. he writes thus. "There is no Infinite,
we are told, for as there is a Finite, the Infinite has its limit in the
Finite, it cannot be Infinite. Now all this is mere playing on words
without thoughts. Why is infinite a negative idea? Because <em>infinite</em> is
derived from <em>finite</em> by means of the negative particle <em>in</em>! But this is a
mere accident, it is a fact in the history of language, and no more. The
same idea may be expressed by the Perfect, the Eternal, the Self-existing,
which are positive terms, or contain at least no negative element. That
negative words may express positive ideas was known perfectly to Greek
philosophers such as Chrysippus, and they would as little have thought
of calling <em>immortal</em> a negative idea as they would have considered <em>blind</em>
positive. The true idea of the Infinite is neither a negation nor a modification
of any other idea. The Finite, on the contrary, is in reality the
limitation or modification of the Infinite, nor is it possible, if we reason
in good earnest, to conceive of the Finite in any other sense than as the
shadow of the Infinite. Even Language will confess to this, if we cross-examine
her properly." He adds a happy quotation from Roger Bacon:
"'et dicitur infinitum non per privationem terminorum quantitatis, sed
per negationem corruptionis et non esse.' Oxford of the nineteenth
century need not be ashamed, as far as metaphysics are concerned, of
Oxford of the thirteenth." Coleridge's theory of the Intuitive reason is
well known to most readers.</p></div>

Any one who tries and fails, may be glad to learn that eminent metaphysicians

affirm that such and such a position must be <em>untrue</em> "because it is

questions, <i>e.g.</i>, "Do you mean inconceivable to yourself or to the generality
of Mankind?" If the latter, "Is the contradictory also inconceivable?"
Again, "Do you mean by the word inconceivable, <em>unthinkable</em>
or <em>unimaginable</em>?" Few people clearly consider this last distinction.
Further, "If unthinkable, is it absolutely so, or only very difficult to
think?" And it seems likewise important to deliberate whether any
position ought to be pronounced absolutely unthinkable, unless the
human mind lies under a stern necessity of thinking and accepting its
contradictory.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_92_113" id="Footnote_92_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_113"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> "Conceivable" and other like expressions are always relative to
conceiving minds; and what appears either conceivable or inconceivable
to one mind, may be the contrary to another. A painter not only conceives,&mdash;but
draws a Centaur, and places him feeding on a wide plain or
sloping hill side. But, can the Physiologist conceive such a monstrosity?
The solution is easy; the painter thinks of his figure, the physiologist of
the structure; and this example furnishes a good caution as to the use
of similar words.
</p>
<p>
From words we may pass to ideas. Take any conception involving
the condition of Time or Space,&mdash;(those two optical tubes of our mind's
perceiving eye),&mdash;and place it before the understanding; first as a <em>Finite</em>
and next as an <em>Infinite</em>. The result is a conflict of arguments, ending in
a contradiction of all possibility that <em>either</em> way the conception can be
true. Any one moderately acquainted with Kant's best-known work, is
aware that, by thus treating the world's existence, he raises overwhelming
difficulties against its being <em>either</em> limited or unlimited in extent;&mdash;eternal
<em>or</em> having a commencement in duration;&mdash;(p. 338. Ed. Rosenkranz)
yet, the world <em>does</em> exist in fact. Kant goes on to subject other cosmological
ideas to the same enigmatical reasoning, with the same consequences.
</p>
<p>
Some readers of purely modern science, may illustrate this question of
the "<em>conceivable</em>" by what has been written on that extraordinary riddle,
the "<em>four</em> dimensions of space." They will see opinions <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em> in
an article by Professor Sylvester in Nature vol. 1. A note (p. 238)
contains one conclusion of the Professor's, interesting as <em>his</em> answer to a
question asked by us a few paragraphs back. He says, "If an Aristotle,
or Descartes, or Kant assures me that he recognises God in the conscience,
I accuse my own blindness if I fail to see with him.... I acknowledge
two separate sources of authority,&mdash;the collective sense of mankind,
and the illumination of privileged intellects." Plato then may
have really <em>seen</em> more than Lucretius&mdash;Coleridge more than Comte or
Littré.</p></div>

says there is no "mode of conceiving the subject which does not

be termed infinite." The numeration in the text is a rough and ready
shape of statement at once intelligible. But it is interesting to view the
subject more exactly.&mdash;Light travels in one second 192,000 miles. Each
mile contains 63,360 inches, and in each inch are 39,000 waves of red
light, calculated at their <em>mean</em> length. Now, multiply these three sets
of figures together, and we get a rate of 474,439,680,000,000 red waves per
second. The mean length of a violet wave is the 1/57500th part of an
inch; and by a like multiplication we find a product of 699,494,400,000,000
of violet light-strokes thrown upon the retina in each second. The phrase
"<em>millions of millions</em>" is used in the text, because few people realize the

a chorus or a symphony is a commotion of elastic air, of which the wildest
sea would give a very inadequate image. The lowest tone which the ear
perceives is due to about 30 vibrations in one second, the highest to about
4,000. Consider then what happens in a <i>Presto</i> when thousands of voices
and instruments are simultaneously producing waves of air, each wave
crossing the other, not only like the surface waves of the water, but like
spherical bodies, and, as it would seem, without any perceptible disturbance;
consider that each tone is accompanied by secondary tones, that
each instrument has its peculiar <i>timbre</i>, due to secondary vibrations;
and, lastly, let us remember that all this cross-fire of waves, all this
whirlpool of sound, is moderated by laws which determine what we call
harmony, and by certain traditions or habits which determine what we
call melody&mdash;both these elements being absent in the songs of birds&mdash;that
all this must be reflected like a microscopic photograph on the two small
organs of hearing, and there excite not only perception, but perception
followed by a new feeling even more mysterious, which we call either
pleasure or pain; and it will be clear that we are surrounded on all sides
by miracles transcending all we are accustomed to call miraculous, and
yet disclosing to the genius of an Euler or a Newton laws which admit of
the most minute mathematical determination." <cite>Science of Language</cite>,

see much as ours do when in a normal state. Colour blindness is frequent
in Man and occurs between red and green, yet a bull distinguishes the
two like a <em>healthy</em>, human being. He is allured by the sight of a green
field, and lashes himself into fury when a red rag is waved before him.
</p>
<p>
The eyes of insects are very far removed in structure from ours. A
butterfly's compound eye contains 17,000 tubes, that of the Mordella
beetle 25,000. Their perception of colours appears vivid and distinct.
They resemble birds, reptiles, and other creatures in choosing for their
lairs and resting-places objects <em>coloured like themselves</em>. It is not difficult
to mount one of these compound eyes, so as to look through it by aid of
a lens placed in focus. Leeuwenhoeck looked through the eye of a dragon
fly (made up of 12,544 tubes), "and viewed the steeple of a church which
was 299 feet high, and 750 feet from the place where he stood. He could
plainly see the steeple, though not apparently larger than the point of
a fine needle. He also viewed a house in the same manner, and could
discern the front, distinguish the doors and windows, and perceive
whether they were open or shut." See <cite>Insect Miscellanies</cite>, p. 129.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_98_120" id="Footnote_98_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_98_120"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> Two points connected with colour admit of being easily experimented
on, and deserve from their interest to be made the subjects of repeated
observations.
</p>
<p>
The first has relation to the question of <em>primary</em> colours;&mdash;are they
alike in man and in <em>all</em> the lower animals?&mdash;In birds and reptiles there
are anatomical reasons for believing the primaries to be red, yellow, and
blue. But are they the same in our race?&mdash;may they not more probably
be red, green, and violet? In this case yellow is the transition from red
to green, blue from green to violet. As colour blindness consists in an
insensibility to red, and as the outer circle of the field of vision is feeble
in its reds, the number of experiments which might be suggested is
evidently considerable.
</p>
<p>
Let a person place two threads respectively red and green near the
bridge of the nose, so as to be seen by the inner angle of the pupil only.
If dexterously moved, both seem green;&mdash;if not, both will in time become
black. Where the want of sensitive appreciation of red is great, the
same result follows in every part of the field of sight. Thus reverend
gentlemen in former times have been induced to wear scarlet hose under
the impression that they had put on black silk; and in these railroad
days many persons find themselves unable to distinguish between the
safety and the danger signal lights. It seems strange indeed that any
scientific advisers of railway Boards should have recommended for use
the two colours, above all others, most likely to get confounded.
</p>
<p>
The theory which supposes red, green, and violet to be Man's three
primary colours is the hypothesis of our great countryman Dr. Thomas
Young, and deserves much more consideration than was for a long time
awarded it. If we may judge of his theory by his appreciation of pictures
it must have been excellent;&mdash;the present writer saw with admiration in
1845 the grand series of Reynolds' portraits which Dr. Young had left
behind him.
</p>
<p>
The second topic of interest is the inquiry into the number and tone
of subjective colours. A perfect theory of colour ought, of course, to
embrace all possible human sensations of the kind. Now many persons
are able to see in dreams a rich amber light far softer and more pure
than any tint ever beheld by the Eye. It generally appears to irradiate
Space, and silvery figures, most often the celestial orbs, float within it.
A still more beautiful production of reflex energy exerted after tranquil
rest is the blending of delicate green with a hyacinthine hue quite strange
to this world, and indescribably lovely in its tender shadings off. By
means of this subjective activity the experiments of Goethe and J. Müller
may be varied almost <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>. The easiest plan is on first waking to
keep the eyelids steadily closed, and watch for the unbidden rise of tints.
Persons of strong pictorial and poetic powers can, after some practice,
control their appearance and succession; and much diversity may be
produced by slightly separating the fringe of eyelashes and looking
between the loosely pressed fingers. The remarkable point in these and
similar experiments seems to be that we are thus enabled to gaze upon
beauties more marvellous than the outward eye ever beheld&mdash;yet we
<em>see</em> them.
</p>
<p>
Another and a painful source of knowledge on this subject consists in
registering the visual impressions of persons bodily or mentally diseased.
The difference between these and the normal impressions of healthy
people would seem to arise from reflex action, the disordered sensory or
mind reacting upon the optic apparatus; or, as it may be said, the centre
of our being is through these aberrations made manifest in its control of
the circumference.
</p>
<p>
Now, it will be obvious to any reflective person how very important
all information we can acquire respecting this central empire over the
impressions of our sense-nerves may become when we try to estimate the
conditions of human knowledge. If it be true that the Mind imposes
laws of activity on the nervous system even when receiving impressions
from it, then the necessity we are under of <em>thinking</em> in accordance with
certain inly imposed laws receives a most striking illustration. And the
inference from it carries an <i lang="la">a fortiori</i> probability since our thoughts lie
nearer to our mental centre than any of our sense-impressions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_99_121" id="Footnote_99_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_99_121"><span class="label">[99]</span></a> Nerves of common feeling are acutely sensitive when divided, and the
patient animal under a Majendie or a dentist utters a sharp shriek. The
case is different with motor nerves, with those of the sympathetic system,
and with (what is more to our purpose) nerves of sensation. It seems
clear that mechanical injuries, or even touches, excite them in the direction
of their own special functions. Auditory nerves feel a shock as a
sound,&mdash;optic nerves receive it as a sudden and brilliant light. We are
doubly assured from these effects of the true functions belonging to the
several sets of nerves. Disease and injury are great discoverers of what
ought to be healthy susceptibilities. In such cases, however, they prove
also something more agreeable to think upon. They prove that suffering
is confined within definite limits, and that <em>economy</em> of pain forms part of
the universal design, for the sensitive animal as well as the sensitive
man. If all our nerves shrank equally with equal tenderness, life would
be a history of protracted agony. Yet one might have expected, <i lang="la">primâ
facie</i>, that a fibre which telegraphs shapes and colours with their blendings,
would eloquently tell the story of its own occasional anguish. And our
whole nervous framework might have been conceived as an instrument
of torture. It has not been so constituted.

256, 7, and 259.
</p>
<p>
"We have already seen enough to answer the question whether it is
possible to maintain the natural and innate conviction that the quality
of our sensations, and especially our sensations of sight, give us a true
impression of corresponding qualities in the outer world. It is clear that
they do not. The question was really decided by Johannes Müller's
deduction from well ascertained facts of the law of specific nervous energy.
Whether the rays of the sun appear to us as colour, or as warmth, does
not at all depend upon their own properties, but simply upon whether
they excite the fibres of the optic nerve, or those of the skin. Pressure
upon the eyeball, a feeble current of electricity passed through it, a
narcotic drug carried to the retina by the blood, are capable of exciting
the sensation of light just as well as the sunbeams. The most complete
difference offered by our several sensations, that namely between those
of sight, of hearing, of taste, of smell, and of touch&mdash;this deepest of all
distinctions, so deep that it is impossible to draw any comparison of likeness,
or unlikeness, between the sensations of colour and of musical tones&mdash;does
not, as we now see, at all depend upon the nature of the external
object, but solely upon the central connections of the nerves which are
affected.... But not only uneducated persons, who are accustomed
to trust blindly to their senses, even the educated, who know that
their senses may be deceived, are inclined to demur to so complete a
want of any closer correspondence in kind between actual objects and
the sensations they produce than the law I have just expounded. For
instance, natural philosophers long hesitated to admit the identity of the
rays of light and of heat, and exhausted all possible means of escaping
a conclusion which seemed to contradict the evidence of their senses.
</p>
<p>
"Another example is that of Goethe, as I have endeavoured to show
elsewhere. He was led to contradict Newton's theory of colours, because
he could not persuade himself that white, which appears to our sensation
as the purest manifestation of the brightest light, could be composed of
darker colours. It was Newton's discovery of the composition of light
that was the first germ of the modern doctrine of the true functions of
the senses; and in the writings of his contemporary, Locke, were correctly
laid down the most important principles on which the right interpretation
of sensible qualities depends. But, however clearly we may feel that
here lies the difficulty for a large number of people, I have never found
the opposite conviction of certainty derived from the senses so distinctly
expressed that it is possible to lay hold of the point of error: and the
reason seems to me to lie in the fact that beneath the popular notions
on the subject lie other and more fundamentally erroneous conceptions."</p></div>

<p>
We have all of us always believed in the veritable existence of this

concerning which our senses inform us&mdash;the identical Self which receives
their information&mdash;are entities no man ordinarily thinks of calling in

Let any one sit down and try to imagine himself a human animal let

of men if similarly unbelieving? Yet what are the conditions or evidences
of veracity upon which his and his fellows' present convictions
must necessarily repose? Can he and others help believing them true?

understanding may be new to the majority of my readers:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"We have seen two notorious instances of <em>sensitive deception</em>, which
justifie the charge of <cite>Petron. Arbiter</cite>.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="verse">

</div></div>

<p>
And yet to speak properly, and to do our <em>senses</em> right, simply they are
not deceived, but only administer an occasion to our forward <em>understandings</em>
to deceive themselves: and so though they are some way accessory
to our delusion; yet the more principal faculties are the <em>Capital offenders</em>.
Thus if the <em>Senses</em> represent the <em>Earth</em> as <em>fixt</em> and <em>immoveable</em>; they give
us the truth of their <em>Sentiments</em>: To <em>sense</em> it is <em>so</em>, and it would be deceit
to present it otherwise. For (as we have shewn) though it do <em>move</em> in
itself; it <em>rests</em> to us, who are carry'd with it.... But if hence
our Understandings falsely deduct, that there is the same quality in the
<em>external impressor</em>; 'tis, it is <em>criminal</em>, our <em>sense</em> is <em>innocent</em>. When the
<em>Ear</em> tingles, we really hear a <em>sound</em>: If we judge it without us, it's the
fallacy of our <em>Judgments</em>. The <em>apparitions</em> of our frighted <em>Phancies</em> are
real <em>sensibles</em>: But if we translate them without the compass of our
Brains, and apprehend them as external objects; it's the unwary rashness
of our <em>Understanding</em> deludes us. And if our disaffected Palates resent
nought but bitterness from our choicest viands, we truly tast the unpleasing
quality, though falsely conceive it in that, which is no more then the
occasion of its production. If any find fault with the novelty of the
notion; the learned St. <i>Austin</i> stands ready to confute the charge: and
they who revere <i>Antiquity</i>, will derive satisfaction from so venerable
a suffrage. He tells us, <i lang="la">Si quis remum frangi in aquâ opinatur, et, cum</i>
<i lang="la">aufertur,integrari; non malum habet internuncium, sed malus est Judex</i>.
And onward to this purpose, The sense could not otherwise perceive it
in the <em>water</em>, neither ought it: For since the <em>Water</em> is one thing, and the
<em>Air</em> another; 'tis requisite and necessary, that the <em>sense</em> should be as
different as the <em>medium</em>: Wherefore the Eye sees aright; if there be
a mistake, 'tis the Judgement's the Deceiver. Elsewhere he saith, that
our Eyes misinform us not, but faithfully transmit their resentment to
the mind. And against the <em>Scepticks</em>, That it's a piece of injustice to
complain of our <em>senses</em>, and to exact from them an account, which is
beyond the sphear of their notice: and resolutely determines, <em>Quicquid
possunt videre oculi, verum vident</em>. So that what we have said of the
<em>senses deceptions</em>, is rigidly to be charg'd only on our careless Understandings,
misleading us through the ill management of sensible informations."
Glanvill, <cite>Vanity of Dogmatizing</cite>. Chap. x. First Ed. p. 91, seq.
</p>
<p>
The reader may like to consider how far Glanvill's apology for the
senses is removed from the following propositions laid down by a recent
writer just quoted who thus defends while he limits the veracity of
sense-impressions:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"What we directly apprehend," writes Professor Helmholtz, "is not
the immediate action of the external exciting cause upon the ends of our
nerves, but only the changed condition of the nervous fibres which we
call the state of <em>excitation</em> or functional activity." And further on:&mdash;"The
simple rule for all illusions of sight is this: <em>we always believe that
we see such objects as would, under conditions of normal vision, produce the
retinal image of which we are actually conscious</em>. If these images are such
as could not be produced by any normal kind of observation, we judge of
them according to their nearest resemblance; and in forming this judgment,
we more easily neglect the parts of sensation which are imperfectly
than those which are perfectly apprehended. When more than one interpretation
is possible, we usually waver involuntarily between them; but
it is possible to end this uncertainty by bringing the idea of any of the
possible interpretations we choose as vividly as possible before the mind
by a conscious effort of the will." Helmholtz on <cite>The Recent Progress of
the Theory of Vision</cite>. pp. 230, 31 and p. 307.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_104_128" id="Footnote_104_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104_128"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> Two acute reasoners, who will be alternately acquitted of madness
by contending schools of thought, have arrived at conclusions very favourable
to the sanity of idealizing men. In his first lecture at the Royal
Institution, Professor Masson spoke in the following terms of <cite>Hume</cite> and
<cite>Fichte</cite>. "There is the system of Nihilism, or, as it may be better called,
Non-Substantialism. According to this system, the Phænomenal Cosmos,
whether regarded as consisting of two parallel successions of phænomena
(Mind <em>and</em> Matter), or of only one (Mind <em>or</em> Matter), resolves itself, on
analysis, into an absolute Nothingness,&mdash;mere appearances with no credible
substratum of Reality; a play of phantasms in a void. If there have
been no positive or dogmatic Nihilists, yet both Hume for one purpose,
and Fichte for another, have propounded Nihilism as the ultimate issue
of all reasoning that does not start with some <i lang="la">à priori</i> postulate."&mdash;Recent
British Philosophy, p. 66. The reader will observe that to raise the
question fully, we have spoken of the special form of Idealism to which
Mr. Mill gives the first place in his description, (Examination of Hamilton's
Philosophy, p. 8.) "According to one of the forms, the sensations
which, in common parlance, we are said to receive from objects, are not
only all that we can possibly know of the objects, but are all that we
have any ground for believing to exist.&mdash;&mdash;Those who hold this opinion
are said to doubt or deny the existence of matter. They are sometimes
called by the name Idealists, sometimes by that of Sceptics,
according to the other opinions which they hold. They include the
followers of Berkeley and those of Hume. Among recent thinkers, the
acute and accomplished Professor Ferrier, though by a circuitous path,
and expressing himself in a very different phraseology, seems to have
arrived at essentially the same point of view. These philosophers maintain
the Relativity of our knowledge in the most extreme form in which
the doctrine can be understood, since they contend, not merely that all
we can possibly know of anything is the manner in which it affects
the human faculties, but that there is nothing else to be known; that
affections of human or of some other minds are all that we can know
to exist."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Mill's own position will be found in his 11th Chapter. After
defining Matter to be a "Permanent Possibility of Sensation," (p. 227)
and explaining his definition, he writes in a note (p. 232), the following
decisive sentences: "My able American critic, Dr. H. B. Smith, contends
through several pages that these facts afford no proofs that objects <em>are</em>
external to us. I never pretended that they do. I am accounting for
our conceiving, or representing to ourselves, the Permanent Possibilities
as real objects external to us. I do not believe that the real externality
to us of anything, except other minds, is capable of proof."
</p>
<p>
Mr. O'Hanlon's pamphlet entitled "A Criticism of John Stuart
Mill's Pure Idealism; and an attempt to shew that, if logically carried
out, it is Pure Nihilism," seems less known than it deserves to be. Mr.
Mill noticed and answered it in his 3rd Edition&mdash;chiefly among the
criticisms commencing p. 244.&mdash;&mdash;Mr. O'Hanlon's early decease has given
a painful interest to his promising labours. Some paragraphs from his
now scarce pamphlet are placed at the end of Additional Note D, on
"Pure Idealism."</p></div>

this topic in his literary estimate of Dr. Johnson. "How it
chanced that a man who reasoned on his premises so ably, should assume
his premises so foolishly, is one of the great mysteries of human nature.
The same inconsistency may be observed in the schoolmen of the middle
ages. Those writers show so much acuteness and force of mind in
arguing on their wretched data, that a modern reader is perpetually at
a loss to comprehend how such minds came by such data. Not a flaw
in the superstructure of the theory which they are rearing escapes their
vigilance. Yet they are blind to the obvious unsoundness of the foundation.
It is the same with some eminent lawyers. Their legal arguments
are intellectual prodigies, abounding with the happiest analogies
and the most refined distinctions. The principles of their arbitrary
science being once admitted, the statute-book and the reports being once
assumed as the foundations of reasoning, these men must be allowed to
be perfect masters of logic. But if a question arises as to the postulates
on which their whole system rests, if they are called upon to vindicate
the fundamental maxims of that system which they have passed their
lives in studying, these very men often talk the language of savages or
of children." (<cite>Essays</cite>, Ed. 1852. p. 175.) As to the schoolmen, any one
who wishes to form a fair idea of their acuteness with little trouble to
himself, may consult the "Synopsis Distinctionum" of H. L. Castanæus,
a book found in most learned libraries.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_Y_131" id="Footnote_Y_131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Y_131"><span class="label">[y]</span></a> See Additional Note <a href="#E.3">E</a>.&mdash;The great interest of this subject for our
purpose lies in the circumstance that the relation of Theory to Fact is
in effect a question most closely akin to the one already mooted concerning
the relation of our Sensations to our Perceptions (compare Additional
Note B). These two questions are indeed so very similar as to be in the
main identical. What we want to learn regarding both relations, is, <em>first</em>,
the <em>extent</em> of the relativity to our human nature; in other words how
<em>much we</em> have <em>mentally put</em> into our Theories and Sensations <em>before</em> we
treat them as Facts and Perceptions. <em>Secondly</em>, what reason we have
for believing <em>any</em> of our knowledge comprehended under either or both
of these relativities (Perception and Fact) to be true <em>beyond</em> our human
sphere; and, above all, whether we are able to assert, on good grounds,
that such and such parts of either kind of our knowledge are absolutely
and immutably true?&mdash;
</p>
<p>
If, for example, we ask&mdash;Is it thus true that there are real objects
external to ourselves? "I do not believe," Mr. Mill has told us, "that
the real externality to us of anything, except other minds, is capable of
proof." And a few lines further, "The view I take of externality, in
the sense in which I acknowledge it as real, could not be more accurately
expressed than in Professor Fraser's words." These are "For ourselves
we can conceive only&mdash;(1) An externality to our present and transient
experience in <em>our own</em> possible experience past and future, and (2) An
externality to our own conscious experience, in the contemporaneous, as
well as in the past or future experience of <em>other minds</em>." (<cite>On Hamilton.</cite>
p. 232, note.) This explanation, Mill had just before observed, is an
externality in the only sense we need care about; and it means in plain
words, that we possess no absolutely true but only some utilitarian knowledge
of the real existence of an outside world. We must, however, and
do care infinitely more for another kind of answer to quite another kind
of question. Is the antithesis between Right and Wrong,&mdash;the Moral
Imperative "Do this and live, transgress and die,"&mdash;absolutely and
immutably true? If not, who would calculate profit and loss as they
are calculated in the Gospel; who would or could believe in a Righteous
that is to say, a Real and True God?
</p>
<p>
Many minds, appalled by the vastness of these issues, and finding no
satisfactory answer to questions of such infinite importance, have fallen
back on the position of Dr. Newman in his <cite>Grammar of Assent</cite>. But the
unsatisfactory characteristic attaching to this position, is that there seems
to be no <em>limit</em> to such Assents, because there appears no Reasonable canon
or maxim to explain, defend, and regulate them. To the far larger number
of minds the problem states itself as a dilemma. There are exactly two
alternatives open to Man. His choice lies between two contrasted positions&mdash;the
most antagonistic conceivable, yet both resulting from one
common supposed fact. Ignorance and impotence are the truest characters
inscribed upon our Reason. Man must decide either for an
unlimited Doubt such as that which Hume delineates, wide as the universal
whole of our human Existence; or else yield the kind of Assent
to which Dr. Newman invites as being the sole secure refuge for any soul
driven by despair into a recoil from utter absence of belief and hope&mdash;the
want of everything to trust and love. Now, let it be observed that
an assent transcending reasonable proof is, in effect, a confession that
Reason falls short of establishing those transcendental truths to which
the mind has thus assented. And contrariwise, limitless Doubt making
all else uncertain, affirms with unmistakeable decisiveness the impotence
of human Reason.&mdash;"The observation of human blindness and weakness,"
says Hume, "is the result of all philosophy, and meets us at every turn,
in spite of our endeavours to elude or avoid it." Hence, we see that
Hume's conclusion is identical with that underlying a position directly
antagonistic to his own, and in this respect <i lang="fr">les extrêmes se touchent</i>.
</p>
<p>
It follows, then, with equal clearness, that any Dilemma which restricts
human choice to the two alternatives above stated, rests upon a denial
that Man's Reason can guide Mankind to truth&mdash;(and by consequence
that he can ever feel after and find his God);&mdash;whilst, conversely, this
same denial, if posited as a basis of speculation, permits no human choice
beyond the two horns of a Dilemma thus made necessarily imperative
upon us all.
</p>
<p>
Neither alternative, however, can be accepted by the Natural Theologian,
nor can he possibly receive any such Dilemma as founded in
Truth or Reason. On the one hand the Superhuman, and Supernatural
lie outside his science which has for its sphere Nature, including Man's
Nature; and which steadily endeavours to attain the true interpretation
and evidence yielded by both Natures, to a belief extending beyond their
present territory and fluent conditions. On the other hand, his science
becomes impossible if unlimited Doubt is the sole dreary prospect open
to the philosophic inquirer. And with his science all other sciences must
perish. Doubt saps the foundations of them all; common-sense facts,
scientific theories, and practical every-day beliefs, are all impartially
shewn to be baseless. So far as our realities are concerned

<p>
Let it be observed in conclusion, that the mode in which common-sense
people are accustomed to treat the primary tenets of most sciences, and
the validity of their own ordinary beliefs, may be placed in curious contrast
with their attitude towards the proofs of Natural Theology. In the
former case, acceptance is easy and wholesale; in the latter, every mind
seems to bristle with objections. Now there are evidently thousands who
<em>must</em> surrender their judgments to the demands of a present and pressing
utility, and must take upon trust a multitude of maxims which they can
never hope to investigate. The difficulties necessarily involved in each
and all of these easy acceptations thus remain unsuspected, and cannot
therefore be placed side by side with the difficulties of Theism.
</p>
<p>
But, next arises a serious question. How far can a similar facility of
wholesale acceptance and a similar absence of comparison with deeper
truths, be considered a philosophic or even a fair procedure in the case of
men and women who <em>think</em> themselves into Atheism?</p>

an enormous amount of speculative difficulty, and is received as the daily
basis of human action in the face of doubts, which speculatively considered
are absolutely insoluble. There is (as will appear in Chapter IV.)
reason to extend this remark beyond what is commonly called practical
truth far into the realm of speculative knowledge, or to speak more
exactly, of all knowledge whatsoever. Suppose, for instance, the continuity
of our inward power of receiving sense-impressions, of knowing,
and reasoning; (our personal Identity) is a groundless belief;&mdash;Suppose
too that our sense-impressions are reflections from self-created shadows
and not from objective realities;&mdash;<em>where</em> can any knowledge be truly
subsistent save in that place of exile now generally termed "the Unknowable"?

sense of a Moral Law which can neither change nor perish&mdash;a Law at
once human and Divine. This strong protest is both in thought and
expression a complete contrast to the ordinary tone of Mr. Mill's disquisitions,
attempered as they generally are between benevolence and
expediency. Instead of pondering the Utilities of a race which, comparatively
speaking, began to exist yesterday, it appeals with decisive
sternness, once and for ever, to the Immutable and the Absolute. It
reminds one of a torch-bearing Prometheus pitted against the selfish
despot of a new and morally enfeebled Olympus. See Additional Note G.</p></div>

against his theory. Towards the end of his Dialogues Hylas (who clings to
the olden elemental nature) speaks thus: "To say, There is no Matter in the
World, is still shocking to me. Whereas to say&mdash;There is no Matter, if by that
Term be meant an unthinking Substance existing without the Mind; but if
by Matter is meant some sensible Thing, whose Existence consists in being
perceived, then there is Matter:&mdash;this Distinction gives it quite another Turn;
and Men will come into your Notions with small Difficulty, when they are
proposed in that manner." Lord Byron condescended to repeat the "coxcombs'
grin"&mdash;

<p><a name="Footnote_130_158" id="Footnote_130_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_130_158"><span class="label">[130]</span></a> Read for example the following eloquent passages from Berkeley's "Three
Dialogues." Philonous, who represents Berkeley himself, says: "To me it is
evident, for the Reasons you allow of, that sensible Things cannot exist otherwise
than in a Mind or Spirit. Whence I conclude, not that they have no real
Existence, but that seeing they depend not on my Thought, and have an
Existence distinct from being perceived by me, <em>there must be some other Mind
wherein they exist</em>. As sure, therefore, as the sensible World really exists, so
sure is there an infinite omnipresent Spirit who contains and supports it.
</p>
<p>
"Hylas. What! This is no more than I and all Christians hold; nay, and
all others too who believe there is a God, and that he knows and comprehends
all Things.
</p>
<p>
"Phil. Ay, but here lies the Difference. Men commonly believe that all
Things are known or perceived by God, because they believed the Being of a
God, whereas I, on the other side, immediately and necessarily conclude the
Being of a God, because all sensible Things must be perceived by Him.
</p>
<p>
"Hylas. But so long as we all believe the same thing, what matter is it how
we come by that Belief?
</p>
<p>
"Phil. But neither do we agree in the same Opinion. For Philosophers, tho'
they acknowledge all corporeal Beings to be perceived by God, yet they attribute
to them an absolute Subsistence distinct from their being perceived by any
Mind whatever, which I do not. Besides, is there no Difference between saying,
<em>There is a God, therefore he perceives all Things</em>: and saying, <em>Sensible Things
do really exist: and if they really exist, they are necessarily perceived by an
infinite Mind: therefore there is an infinite Mind, or God?</em> This furnishes
you with a direct and immediate Demonstration, from a most evident Principle,
of the <em>Being of a God</em>....
</p>
<p>
Hylas. It cannot be denied, there is something highly serviceable to Religion
in what you advance. But do you not think it looks very like a Notion entertained
by some eminent Moderns, of <em>seeing all things in God</em>?
</p>
<p>
Phil. I would gladly know that Opinion; pray explain it to me.
</p>
<p>
Hylas. They conceive that the Soul, being immaterial, is incapable of being
united with material Things, so as to perceive them in themselves, but that she
perceives them by her Union with the Substance of God, which being spiritual,
is therefore purely intelligible, or capable of being the immediate Object of a
Spirit's Thought. Besides, the Divine Essence contains in it Perfections correspondent
to each created Being; and which are, for that Reason, proper to
exhibit or represent them to the Mind.
</p>
<p>
Phil. I do not understand how our Ideas, which are Things altogether
passive and inert, can be the Essence, or any Part (or like any Part) of the
Essence or Substance of God, who is an impassive, indivisible, purely active
Being. Many more Difficulties and Objections there are, which occur at first
View against this Hypothesis, but I shall only add, that it is liable to all the
Absurdities of the common Hypotheses in making a created World exist otherwise
than in the Mind of a Spirit. Beside all which it has this peculiar to
itself; that it makes that material World serve to no Purpose. And if it pass
for a good Argument against other Hypotheses in the Sciences, that they
suppose Nature or the Divine Wisdom to make something in vain, or do that
by tedious round-about Methods, which might have been performed in a much
more easy and compendious way, what shall we think of that Hypothesis which
supposes the whole World made in vain?
</p>
<p>
Hylas. But what say you, are not you too of Opinion that we see all
Things in God? If I mistake not, what you advance comes near it.
</p>
<p>
Phil. I entirely agree with what the Holy Scripture saith, <em>That in God we
live, and move, and have our Being</em>. But that we see Things in his Essence
after the manner above set forth, I am far from believing. Take here in brief my
Meaning. It is evident that the Things I perceive are my own Ideas, and that
no Idea can exist, unless it be in a Mind. Nor is it less plain that these Ideas
or Things by me perceived, either themselves or their Archetypes exist independently
of my Mind, since I know myself not to be their Author, it being
out of my Power to determine at Pleasure what particular Ideas I shall be
affected with upon opening my Eyes or Ears. They must therefore exist in
some other Mind, whose Will it is they should be exhibited to me. The Things,
I say, immediately perceived, are Ideas or Sensations, call them which you
will. But how can any Idea or Sensation exist in, or be produced by, anything
but a Mind or Spirit? This, indeed, is inconceivable: and to assert that which
is inconceivable, is to talk Nonsense: Is it not?.
</p>
<p>
Hylas. Without doubt.
</p>
<p>
Phil. But on the other hand, it is very conceivable that they should exist in,
and be produced by, a Spirit; since this is no more than I daily experience in
myself, inasmuch as I perceive numberless Ideas; and by an Act of my Will
can form a great Variety of them, and raise them up in my Imagination: Tho'
it must be confessed, these Creatures of the Fancy are not altogether so distinct,
so strong, vivid, and permanent, as those perceived by my Senses, which latter
are called <em>Real Things</em>. From all which I conclude, <em>there is a Mind which
affects me every Moment with all the sensible Impressions I perceive</em>. And
from the Variety, Order, and Manner of these, I conclude the Author of them
to be <em>wise, powerful, and good, beyond comprehension</em>. Mark it well, I do not
say, I see Things by perceiving that which represents them in the intelligible
Substance of God. This I do not understand; but I say, The Things by me
perceived are known by the Understanding, and produced by the Will, of an
infinite Spirit. And is not all this most plain and evident? Is there any more
in it, than what a little Observation of our own Minds, and that which passes
in them not only enables us to conceive, but also obliges us to acknowledge?"

p. 140. We must all regret the loss of Dean Mansel's ultimate thoughts on
"The real error of Berkeley's Idealism." Letters &amp;c. p. 391. But more than
a dozen years earlier, he wrote, (<cite>Prolegomena Logica</cite>, Chap. V.) "The fault of
Berkeley did not consist in doubting the existence of matter, but in asserting
its non-existence." How far Mansel himself went in the direction of this same
doubt may be judged from the following passage, which occurs in the Prolegomena
one page before. "Beyond the range of conscious beings, we can
have only a negative idea of substance. The name is applied in relation to
certain collections of sensible phenomena, natural or artificial, connected with
each other in various ways; by locomotion, by vegetation, by contributing to
a common end, by certain positions in space. But here we have no positive
notion of substance distinct from phenomena. I do not attribute to the billiard
ball a consciousness of its own figure, colour, and motion; but, in denying
consciousness, I deny the only form in which unity and substance have been
presented to me. I have therefore no data for thinking one way or the other
on the question. Some kind of unity between the several phenomena may
exist, or it may not; but if it does exist, it exists in a manner of which I can
form no conception; and if it does not exist, my faculties do not enable me
to detect its absence." In other words (as Mr. O'Hanlon might have phrased
it) "My friend Smith is I know a person,&mdash;therefore a substance. But Smith's
hat and coat, being unconscious, lack the only forms in which unity and
substance have been presented to me. Smith's coat is blue, its fabric woollen;
his hat black, and of silken texture;&mdash;there may or may not be unities in which
these phenomena of colour and structural appearance cohere; my faculties do
not, however, enable me to decide whether hat and coat are or are not <em>positively</em>
substantial unifications.
</p>
<p>
It would appear from all this, that hats and coats and other familiar so-called
substances, are as little <em>essentially</em> known to us as that vast territory of supernatural
Being which has been named the "Unknowable."</p></div>

scepticism of Hume, by whom this observation was chiefly made, should be
clearly marked off from Greek scepticism. Hume founds his remarks on the truth
of the empirical element, on feeling and sensation, and proceeds to attack
universal truths and laws, because they do not derive their authority from
sense-perception. So far was ancient scepticism from making feeling and
sensation a canon of truth, that it turned against the deliverances of sense

covering the thoughtless boy in Tennyson's Gareth and Lynette, or it is
the reflection of a light intuitively flashed through the soul&mdash;the echo of a chord
struck upon the writer's very heart-strings. Such and so deep, beyond doubt,
was the ingenuous feeling of Mr. Mill.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_147_175" id="Footnote_147_175"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147_175"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> This quotation is from his <cite>Matter and Force</cite>, Chapter XIX. Büchner is
never tired of emphasizing the Materialism of thought. In an address prefixed
to his tenth Edition, speaking of the hypothesis of Mind acting on Brain he calls
it "the tragi-comic pianoforte theory," and regrets that there should be so
many "human pianofortes out of tune in the world." Büchner's own Materialism
is outspoken, as may be judged from the following propositions:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1. Spirit without Body is unimaginable.
</p>
<p>
2. The Soul brings with it "no innate intuitions"; and
</p>
<p>
3. It is not an <i lang="la">ens per se</i>, but a product of external influences.
</p>
<p>
4. There is no individual immortality nor personal continuance after death.
</p>
<p>
5. The Soul's knowledge relates only to earthly things.
</p>
<p>
6. It becomes a <em>person</em> by being opposed to earthly individualities.
</p>
<p>
7. (Adopted from C. Vogt) "The soul ... is a product of the development
of the brain; just as muscular activity is a product of muscular development,
and secretion a product of glandular development. So soon as the substances
composing the brain are aggregated in a similar form, will they exhibit the same
functions.... Mental activity changes with the periods of life, and ceases
altogether at death."
</p>
<p>
Büchner's writings are sufficiently known in this country. In America they
are food for the million.
</p>
<p>
Proposition No. 6 is particularly noticeable because it re-echoes the fallacy of
Locke (see page 182-3 <i>ante</i>) on personal identity. By opposition to earthly
individualities we do not "<em>become</em>" persons, but the sense of antagonism between
ourselves and other externalities (both men and things), sharpens every day
our belief in our own personality, and furnishes its daily verification.
</p>
<p>
The grossness of this writer's Materialism does not hinder him from using
the word "soul" on almost every page; and in one of his more recent publications
he is candid enough to acknowledge that this old-fashioned entity is not
yet quite improved off the face of the Earth. He says:&mdash;"Just the properties
of the human mind and the impossibility of explaining them, were from the
most ancient times one of the main supports of spiritualism and theological
systems. True, their explanation is still wanting." Büchner, of course, looks for
the speedy elimination of "Soul" proper, on exactly the same grounds which
underlie his own whole system. Mental activity and Brain go together (he
argues), as Force and Matter go together. It may be answered, that every
practical reasoner knows the danger of arguing from <em>concomitancies</em>, however
well-established, to <em>Causality</em>; and the risk is evidently much increased when
a like argument is used to <em>Identity</em>. Besides, if Mental activity is resolvable
into Brain, why should not Matter be likewise resolved into Force? Thus the
whole Universe, inanimate and animated, material and psychical, becomes
Force. The chain would run in this manner: Mind = Brain = Matter = Force.
But how are we to know that Force must be all of one kind and description?
Or, again, why may not the concomitancies be rather resolved some
other way;&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Matter (including Brain) = Force = Mind? Thus Materialism
might slide into Idealism, Pantheism, or even Theism; since in some shape or
other Mind would form and sustain the Universe. Our last citation of Büchner
is taken from a New York Edition of his <cite>Materialism</cite>, p. 19.</p></div>

Nature is conceived as dominant over the highest also. The whole Universe is
submitted to its iron rule. There is of Man's Mind as well as of the flagstone
with which he paves his streets, one account, one law, one science, one
philosophy; nay, strangely enough, as we shall see further on, one religion!
The law of stocks and stones is supreme, it rules alike Man's present and his
future, and ought to be the sole object of his veneration.
</p>
<p>
Positivism, as is well known, makes many sciences and classifies them by an
ascending scale of Laws. "La Philosophie Positive," writes Littré (<cite>Paroles</cite>,
p. 10) ... "apercevant que, suivant la vraie conception, où la matière n'est pas
séparable de ses propriétés, le mot de matérialisme n'avait plus d'emploi
philosophique qu'en histoire, elle l'a renouvelé, et s'en est servie pour caractériser
l'intrusion de la méthode de toute science inférieure dans la science
supérieure."
</p>
<p>
If Littré had said, "the intrusion of the <em>lowest</em> into the highest," he would
have rightly characterized the systems we are describing.
</p>
<p>
Von Feuchtersleben puts the practical state of the question thus:&mdash;"All we
can say is, that an intellectual world reveals itself to us, by the law of the true,
the good, and the beautiful, and that a physical world manifests itself by those
laws which act in space and time. What lies beyond these laws, as it were the
substance of both worlds, we know not; we only call that of the physical
world, matter or body in the abstract, that of the super-physical, we call
spirit (Geist), and must never forget that hereby we have only pronounced an
abstraction.
</p>
<p>
"But now we ask further, wherein does this higher law manifest itself to us,
as the physical law does in the material world? Nowhere but in man, and in
him only through the medium of his cultivated and refined reason. What we
feel, what we remember, nay, the very inmost sensations of our individual
existence, may be referred to the world which surrounds us. Thought alone,
exalted to the highest degree shows us another world. We are ourselves therefore
not spirit, but we watch, as it were, what we call by that name, and which
manifests itself to us only by its laws. (Est Deus in nobis.) Man, therefore,
should be the link which connects the two worlds; and this is the problem,
this is the enigma, which can never be solved." He adds in a note: "Materialism,
that is, the view which will not allow the separation of the intellectual principle
from the corporeal, but looks upon the former as a higher power of the latter,
not only explains nothing, but makes the enigma still more obscure. <cite>Medical
Psychology</cite>, Ed. Sydenham, pp. 15-16.</p></div>

sort of romance or revel of a half-metaphysical, half-materializing imagination.
The following rather long extract from Haeckel's book will shew the hypothesis
on its most poetical side. But alas for its prose, and its plain practical application!
"It is indeed," he writes, "not difficult to arrive through an unprejudiced
consideration of facts, at a clear conviction that Theism, which has its origin in
Mythology, and which, under the name of "Pure Monotheism," rules the
civilized peoples of modern day, and plays even now so conspicuous a part in
organic Morphology as the Myth of Creation, is in fact not Monotheism but
<span class="smcap">Amphitheism</span>. This predominant religion was <span class="smcap">Monotheism</span> only so long as
all Natural Phenomena were, without any exception, taken to be the direct
result of the personal divine government of the world,&mdash;only so long as all
inorganic or organic Phenomena&mdash;from the blowing of the wind and the
rolling of the thunder, to the light of the sun and the course of the stars;
from the flowery fragrance of plants and the wing of the bird, to the Mind-formation
of Man and the development-history of peoples;&mdash;were direct actions
of a monarchical, personal Creator. But when modern Natural Science demonstrated
that the whole realm of inorganic Nature was governed by fixed,
unvarying laws of Nature; when Physics and Chemistry reduced Abiology to
mathematical formulæ, then the half of his realm was wrested from the personal
Creator, and there remained to him organic Nature alone, and even the half of
this was next set free by recent Physiology, so that organic Morphology alone
remained subject to the personal, arbitrary government of the mediatised ruler
of the world. Thus, out of the earlier Monotheism grew up that full-blown
Amphitheism which at present rules the modern Cosmology of civilized peoples;
and which appears in Science as the thoroughly perverted Dualism against
which we have contended most determinedly in our General Morphology. For,
what else is this Dualism but the battle between two Gods of fundamentally
distinct natures? On the one hand, we see in the realm of Abiology, dominated
by Mechanism, the exclusive sovereignty of unvarying and necessary Nature-laws,
of the <i lang="el">ἀναγκη</i>, which at all times and in all places constantly remains one
and the same.
</p>
<p>
"On the other hand, in the realm of Biology (which is still governed by
Teleology), and especially in the realm of organic Morphology, we see the
ridiculous arbitrary government of a personal and thoroughly humanlike
Creator, who vainly wearies himself with endeavouring to create a 'perfect'
Organism, and constantly rejects the earlier creations of a 'former age,' in
that he is continually setting up new and improved editions in their places.
We have already shewn, in our sixth chapter, why we must entirely reject
this pitiful idea of a personal Creator (Vol. I. p. 173). It is in fact a degradation
of the pure God-Idea. Most men picture to themselves this 'beloved God'
as being thoroughly humanlike: he is in their eyes an architect, who is engaged
in carrying on the construction of the world according to some previously
rejected plan; but who never gets done with it, because during the process
of completion, he is always hitting on new and better ideas; he is a Stage-manager,
who directs the earth like a great puppet-play, and generally knows
how to handle with tolerable skill the numerous threads by which he manages
the hearts of men: he is a half-deprived king who only rules over the inorganic
realm conditionally, and according to firmly fixed laws; rules on the other
hand over the organic realm absolutely as patriarchal land-father, who in this
domain allows himself to be led into a daily alteration of his world-plan by
the wishes and prayers of his own children, among whom the most perfect
Vertebrates are those principally favoured.
</p>
<p>
"Let us turn away from this unworthy Anthropomorphism of modern
Dogmatics, which degrade God himself into an aerial Vertebrate, and let us
look on the contrary at the infinitely higher God-Idea to which Monism
conducts us; in that it demonstrates the <span class="smcap">Unity of God</span> in the whole of
Nature, and abolishes the antithesis of an organic and inorganic God which
sows the germ of a death-agony in the heart of that predominating Amphitheism.
Our Cosmology knows only <span class="smcap">One Sole God</span>, and this <span class="smcap">Almighty God</span>
rules the whole of Nature without exception. We contemplate his operation in
all phenomena of every description. To it the whole inorganic material world
is subject, and so too the whole world of organization. If each body <i lang="la">in vacuo</i>
falls fifteen feet in the first second; if three atoms of Oxygen to one of Sulphur
always produce Sulphuric Acid; if the angle which one columnar surface of
rock crystal makes with the neighbouring one is always 120°; then, these
phenomena are the immediate operations of God, equally with the blossoms of
plants, the movements of animals, the thoughts of Mankind. We all exist by
'God's grace'; the stone as well as the water, the Radiolarian as well as the
pine tree, the gorilla as much as the Emperor of China.
</p>
<p>
"This Cosmology which contemplates <span class="smcap">God's spirit and power in all
natural phenomena</span> is alone worthy of His all-comprehensive greatness;
only when we refer all forces and all phenomena of movement, all forms and
properties of matter, to God, as the Author of all things, do we attain to that
human intuition of God, and veneration of God, which really befits his immeasurable
greatness. For 'in Him we live and move and have our being.'
Thus the philosophy of Nature becomes in fact Theology. The worship of
Nature becomes that true worship of God of which Göethe says:&mdash;'<span class="smcap">Certainly
there is no more beautiful veneration of God, than that which
arises from communion with Nature in our own breasts</span>.'
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">God is Almighty</span>; he is the sole Author, the prime Cause of all things;
that is, in other words, <span class="smcap">God is the Universal Causal Law</span>. God is
absolutely perfect; he can never act otherwise than perfectly rightly, therefore
he can never act arbitrarily or freely; that is to say, <span class="smcap">God is Necessity</span>.
God is the sum of all forces; so also, therefore, of all Matter. Every conception
of God, which separates him from Matter, opposes to him a sum of
forces which are not of divine Nature; every such conception leads to Amphitheism,
consequently to Polytheism.
</p>
<p>
"Since <span class="smcap">Monism</span> demonstrates the <span class="smcap">Unity of the whole of Nature</span>, it
proves, likewise, that only <span class="smcap">One God</span> exists, and that this God manifests
himself in the collective phenomena of Nature. Since Monism grounds the
collective phenomena of organic and inorganic Nature on the <span class="smcap">Universal
Causal Law</span>, and displays them as the effects of 'active causes,' it shews
at the same time, that <span class="smcap">God is the necessary Cause of all things and
is the Law itself</span>. Since Monism acknowledges no other beside the divine
Forces in Nature, since it recognizes all laws of Nature as divine, it raises itself
to the greatest and most elevated conception of which man, as the most perfect
of all animals, is capable, to the conception of the <span class="smcap">Unity of God and
Nature</span>.

</p>
<p>
No one who reads the latter part of this quotation will doubt that Haeckel is
a refined, or, in other words, a metaphysical Materialist. That he has produced
an effect in materializing circles is evident; witness the following passages from
Büchner "the crass." "To any one who does not stubbornly and obstinately
cling to old prejudices, this new Cosmology which has superseded the dualism
of former systems of philosophy and thought, must appear as clear, simple, free
of dualism, easily intelligible and perfectly satisfactory. On account of this very
antagonism to the dualistic character of the speculative philosophy of the past,
I should like best to designate the philosophy of Materialism as <em>monistic
philosophy</em>, or <em>philosophy of unity</em>; and the cosmology founded upon it as
<em>monism</em>, in accordance with the suggestion of Professor Haeckel.... Since the
indestructibility of matter, as previously described, has found its necessary
complement in the indestructibility of force; and since the separation of force
and matter has been recognized as a mere abstraction and existing only in
our thoughts: it is really impossible to speak any longer of Materialism as a
system which derives everything from matter only. Otherwise we might just
as well speak of <em>Dynamism</em>, that is of a system that derives everything from
force (dynamis). But in reality both are identical and inseparable; and therefore
a philosophy built upon those ideas cannot be better designated than as
<em>monistic</em>, or a <em>philosophy of unity</em>." (<cite>Materialism, ut supra</cite> p. 24.) This last
phrase is more metaphysical than Büchner's wont; but S. T. Coleridge, if alive,
would tell him that what the world really wants, is a "Philosophy of Multeity
in Unity." To annihilate the Manifold is to destroy our sole knowledge of the One.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_150_178" id="Footnote_150_178"></a><a href="#FNanchor_150_178"><span class="label">[150]</span></a> It was previously intimated that the idealizing philosopher often escapes
ethical censure more easily than he deserves. Idealism may, or may not, be a
bar to irreligious materialism. For example:&mdash;"The materialism of Strauss
was not inconsistent with an idealism of the Hegelian type; for, as he showed
in his last work, the question between logically consistent idealists and materialists
who carry out their principles is, at its roots, one of names and terms
rather than of antagonistic principles." <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> for Feb. 11,
1874. The Idealism referred to, is that which identifies pure Being with
Impersonal Thought. Now Berkeley's idealism culminated with the Divine
Personality, through whose omnipresence and spiritual subsistence those
properties or modes of existence, called material, are realized to us, who,
together with all the world, exist in and by Him. Yet, as far as Berkeley's
argument rests upon the common ground of idealistic reasoning, it is approachable
by the Atheist or the Sceptic. Of Hobbes a reviewer has lately
remarked: "He clearly demonstrated that the secondary qualities of body
are purely subjective, and his language is almost strong enough to lead
us to believe that he would have gone a long way with Berkeley. For he
claims to have proved that 'as in vision, so also in <em>conceptions</em> that arise
from the other senses, the subject of their inherence is not the object but
the sentient.'" <cite>Westminster Review</cite>, April, 1874, p. 387.
</p>
<p>
The truth from which so many theories, physical and metaphysical, branch
out, is thus clearly stated by Professor Huxley. "All the phenomena of
nature are, in their ultimate analysis, known to us only as facts of consciousness."
"On Descartes," <cite>Lay Sermons</cite>, p. 374. This statement is an
incontrovertible proposition; and may help in persuading us to believe
our own souls. At all events, we plainly see that the sum total of our
human knowledge is potentially contained in their evidence.</p></div>

among the sciences directly antagonistic to Materialism. He classifies the
tendencies of scientific studies thus. There are, he says, "Deux directions
opposées auxquelles nous inclinent les deux ordres differents de connaissances:&mdash;la
direction qui aboutit au Materialisme, et c'est celle dans laquelle
nous engagent les mathématiques et la physique, et la direction qui mène
au spiritualisme, et c'est celle où acheminent la biologie et surtout les sciences
morales et esthétiques." (<cite>La Philosophie en France</cite>, p. 98.) His description
of a certain degree of progress in the mind of Comte illustrates this same
idea:&mdash;"Il comprit, en présence de la vie, que ce n'était pas assez, comme il
avait pu le croire dans la sphère des choses mécaniques et physiques, de considérer
des phénomènes à la suite ou à côté les uns des autres, mais que,
de plus, que surtout il fallait prendre en considération l'ordre et l'ensemble.
</p>
<p>
"En présence des êtres organisés, on s'aperçoit, disait-il, que le détail des
phénomènes, quelque explication plus ou moins suffisante qu'on en donne, n'est
ni le tout ni même le principal; que le principal, et l'on pourrait presque dire
le tout, c'est l'ensemble dans l'espace, le progrès dans le temps, et qu'expliquer
un être vivant, ce serait montrer la raison de cet ensemble et de ce progrès, qui
est la vie même....
</p>
<p>
"Dans les sciences des choses inorganiques, disait-il encore, on procède par
déduction des détails au tout; dans les sciences des êtres organisés, c'est de
l'ensemble que se tire par déduction, la vraie connaissance des parties.
</p>
<p>
"De plus, d'accord maintenant avec Platon, Aristote, Leibniz, il déclarait
que l'ensemble étant le résultat et l'expression d'une certaine unité, à laquelle
tout concourt et se co-ordonne et qui est le but où tout marche, c'est dans
cette unité, c'est dans le but, c'est dans la fin ou cause finale qu'est le secret de
l'organisme.
</p>
<p>
"Le 16 Juillet 1843, écrivant à M. Stuart Mill, il exprimait l'opinion que, si
ce savant ne le suivait pas dans les voies plus larges où dorénavant il allait
marchait, c'est que, très-versé dans les études mathématiques et physiques, il
n'était pas assez familier avec les phénomènes de la vie. Plus avancé dans la
science biologique, M. Mill aurait mieux compris comment il faut, outre le
détail des faits, quelque chose qui les domine, qui les combine et les co-ordonne."

make a distinction between science and common life, or between one
science and another. The arguments, employed in all, if just, are of a

any difference among them, the advantage lies entirely on the side of
theology and natural religion."&mdash;<cite>Dialogues, etc.</cite>, Part I. sub. fin.
</p>
<p>
And our ultimate appeal&mdash;as for example concerning the subject next
discussed in this chapter&mdash;is, he observes, to an instinctive operation of
the mind which obliges us to accept and act upon what we cannot explain.
Writing in his own person, Mr. Hume observes, "As nature has taught
us the use of our limbs, without giving us the knowledge of the muscles
and nerves by which they are actuated, so has she implanted in us an
instinct, which carries forward the thought in a correspondent course to
that which she has established among external objects; though we are
ignorant of those powers and forces on which this regular course and
succession of objects totally depends."&mdash;<cite>Inquiry concerning the Human

<p><a name="Footnote_AD_183" id="Footnote_AD_183"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AD_183"><span class="label">[ad]</span></a> The word Belief has been used in a variety of senses by modern
writers of differing views from Jacobi to Sir. W. Hamilton, from Dr.
Newman to Mr. Herbert Spencer.
</p>
<p>
"This word," Mr. Spencer says, "is habitually applied to dicta of
consciousness for which no proof can be assigned: both those which are
unprovable because they underlie all proof, and those which are unprovable
because of the absence of evidence." And again; "we commonly say we
'believe' a thing for which we can assign some preponderating evidence,
or concerning which we have received some indefinable impression....
And it is the peculiarity of these beliefs, as contrasted
with cognitions, that their connexions with antecedent states of consciousness
may be easily severed, instead of being difficult to sever. But
unhappily, the word 'belief' is also applied to each of those temporarily
or permanently indissoluble connexions in consciousness, for the
acceptance of which the only warrant is that it cannot be got rid of....
Thus the two opposite poles of knowledge go under the same name;
and by the reverse connotations of this name, as used for the most
coherent and least coherent relations of thought, profound misconceptions
have been generated."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Spencer made these remarks at separate intervals of time, and has
repeated them in 1874 (<cite>Essays</cite>, III. 259-60). It would therefore appear
that he thinks little has recently been done to discriminate the significations
of so ambiguous a term.
</p>
<p>
This chapter endeavours to investigate a small number of the genus
"Beliefs" to which the <i lang="la">differentia</i> "Of Reason" has been added by way
of distinction. It also attempts to offer a contribution towards the useful
work of explaining their specific validity, and if its argument be
correct, they constitute a very important definable species of the Genus,
carrying with them a persuasion pre-eminently their own.
</p>
<p>
On his page 260, last referred to, Mr. Spencer remarks,&mdash;"that the
belief which the moral and religious feelings are said to yield of a
personal God, is not one of the beliefs which are unprovable because
they underlie all proof"&mdash;and adds that works on Natural Theology treat
that Belief as <em>inferential</em>.
</p>
<p>
The view taken of this moral and religious belief in the present Essay,
is that it is in its own nature <em>both</em> primary and inferential. The former
of these aspects is the one now under discussion.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_155_185" id="Footnote_155_185"></a><a href="#FNanchor_155_185"><span class="label">[155]</span></a> Mr. Fowler, in the little volume just referred to, describes another
"Theory of the Origin of Universal Beliefs," as follows:&mdash;"It would
admit that all beliefs alike are ultimately derived from experience, and
still it would freely adopt the language that there are some beliefs which
are 'native to the human mind.' The word 'experience' as ordinarily
employed by psychologists, includes not only the experience of the
individual, but the recorded experience of mankind. On the theory,
however, of which we are now speaking, it has a still more extended
meaning; it includes experience, or to speak more strictly, a peculiar
facility for forming certain experiences, <em>transmitted</em> by hereditary
descent from generation to generation. While some ideas occur only to
particular individuals, at particular times, there are others which, from
the frequency and constancy with which they are obtruded upon men's
minds at all times and under all circumstances, become, after an
accumulated experience of many generations, <em>connatural</em>, as it were, to
the human mind. We assume them, often unconsciously, in our special
perceptions, and when the propositions, which embody them, are
propounded to us, we find it impossible, on reflection, to doubt their
truth. It is by personal experience of external objects and their relations
that each man recognises them, but the <em>tendency</em> to recognise them is
transmitted, like the physical or mental peculiarities of race, from
preceding generations, and is anterior to any special experience
whatever on the part of the individual. This theory, to which much
of modern speculation appears to be converging, is advocated with
great ability in the works of Mr. Herbert Spencer." <cite>Inductive Logic</cite>,
p. 31.
</p>
<p>
This account of our Belief in the Inductive Principle agrees, in effect,
with the opinion of those who hold that our acceptance of its truth
resembles our acceptance of Mathematical Truths in <em>two</em> very important
respects: (1) Its <em>Certitude</em>. To use Dr. Whewell's words; "We are as
certain of it as of the truths of arithmetic and geometry. We cannot doubt
that it must apply to all events past and future, in every part of the
universe, just as truly as to those occurrences which we have ourselves
observed. <em>What</em> causes produce what effects;&mdash;what is the cause of any
particular event;&mdash;what will be the effect of any peculiar process;&mdash;these
are points on which experience may enlighten us. Observation
and experience may be requisite, to enable us to judge respecting such
matters. But that every event has <em>some</em> cause, Experience cannot prove
any more than she can disprove. She can add nothing to the evidence
of the truth, however often she may exemplify it. This doctrine, then,
cannot have been acquired by her teaching," Whewell's <cite>Hist. of Scientific
Ideas</cite>, B. III. Cap. ii.
</p>
<p>
(2) In the fact of its being <em>intuitive</em>; that is, as Mr. Fowler says,
"connatural," or "native to the human mind."
</p>
<p>
Whether we can trace the process through which it became one of the
mental possessions characteristic of Mankind is a further question, and a
very curious one. The subjects of improvement by education, and of the
transmission of improvements thus acquired among men and the lower
animals, belong in part to our next Chapter;&mdash;they are, of course, deeply
interesting to every philanthropist, every promoter of true progress and
wholesome civilization.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_156_186" id="Footnote_156_186"></a><a href="#FNanchor_156_186"><span class="label">[156]</span></a> Galen remarks upon the immediate activity of animal instinct prior
to example or habituation. Most Naturalists know his experiment of
hatching three different sorts of eggs together. He was much struck to see
the young aquatic bird, reptile, and eaglet, betake themselves at once, each
to his vocation. Some persons referred these instincts to the influence of
organs fitted for definite uses, yet, observes Galen, the young calf will
butt before he has got horns. A good deal might be added to Galen's
rejoinder. Animals seem often to work without fitness of organization,&mdash;or
one might almost say in defiance of their organs. "There is nothing,"
says Sir C. Bell, "in the configuration of the black bear, particularly
adapted for his catching fish; yet he will sit, on his hinder extremities,
by the side of a stream, morning or evening, on the watch, like a practised
fisher, and so perfectly motionless as to deceive the eye of the Indian,
who mistakes him for the burnt trunk of a tree; when he sees his
opportunity favourable, he will thrust out his fore-paw, and seize a fish
with incredible celerity. The exterior organ is not, in this instance, the
cause of the habit or of the propensity; and if we thus see the instinct
bestowed without the appropriate organ, may we not the more readily
believe, in other examples, when the two are conjoined, that the habit
exists with the instrument, although not through it?" (<cite>Bridgewater
Treatise</cite>, Chap. x. p. 250.)&mdash;In Captain Cook's third voyage there is
another anecdote of bears equally curious. "The wild deer (barein) are
far too swift for those lumbering sportsmen; so the bear perceives them
at a distance by the scent; and, as they herd in low grounds, when he
approaches them, he gets upon the adjoining eminence, from whence he
rolls down pieces of rock; nor does he quit his ambush, and pursue, until
he finds that some have been maimed." (Vol. 3, p. 306.)
</p>
<p>
In such cases as these, there is a manifest want of correspondence
between animal organisms and animal instincts, which many naturalists
consider essentially interdependent. Yet on their mutual action and
reaction some have founded a theory of evolution.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_AE_189" id="Footnote_AE_189"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AE_189"><span class="label">[ae]</span></a> Our deep-rooted tendency to trust human testimony may yield a
very curious example of the difficulties presented by the whole class of
pre-rational beliefs. Mr. J. Mill in accordance with his system of foregone
Associations "resolves" this case as follows (<cite>Analysis</cite> I. p. 385-6):
"Belief in testimony is but a case of the anticipation of the future from
the past; and belief in the uniformity of the laws of nature is but
another name for the same thing.... The testimony uniformly calls
up the idea of the reality of the event, so closely, that I cannot disjoin
them. But the idea, irresistibly forced upon me, of a real event, is
Belief."
</p>
<p>
On this explanation Mr. Bain remarks, "The belief in Testimony is
derived from the primary credulity of the mind, in certain instances left
intact under the wear and tear of adverse experience. Hardly any fact
of the human mind is better attested than the primitive disposition to
receive all testimony with unflinching credence. It never occurs to the
child to question any statement made to it, until some positive force on
the side of scepticism has been developed. Gradually we find that certain
testimonies are inconsistent with fact; we have, therefore, to go through
a long education in discriminating the good testimonies from the bad. To
the one class, we adhere with the primitive force of conviction that in the
other class has been shaken and worn away by the shocks of repeated
contradictions."
</p>
<p>
It seems quite possible that our "primary credulity" may be one
example of a wider spread feeling of reliance engendered in part by
affection and dependence. Its force varies considerably in various minds.
Women whose lives have been happy and free from disappointment
retain much of this primary intuitive belief to the end of their days.
Among men, the trust in Testimony becomes controlled by their power
of balancing probabilities; a faculty in which the very credulous and
also the very sceptical are often observed to be deficient. The disappointed
of both sexes proverbially incline to Scepticism.</p></div>

Architecture from Huber downwards. Birds are generally well watched
and well reported. Many Naturalists have written on these subjects,
from a hope of creating in the minds of men some softer interest for
their humble companions. Mr. Jesse naïvely prefaces a collection of
anecdotes, by saying that, of all the nations in Europe, our own countrymen
are perhaps the least inclined to treat the brute creation with
tenderness.
</p>
<p>
Wilson long ago observed that the nest building of birds was not
always the same in the same species. The older birds built the better
nests.
</p>
<p>
M. Pouchet of Rouen proved that when the new streets of that city
were erected, the window-swallows altered their nests and substantially
improved them. A short account of his observations will be found in
Wallace's <cite>Contributions</cite>, 228 A. Mr. Wallace adds several instances of
bad nest building, especially by pigeons, rooks, and window-swallows, a
circumstance also noticed by White of Selborne.
</p>
<p>
Amongst the most remarkable bird-families with special ideas of construction,
are the mound-builders, and bower birds of Australia, described
by Mr. Gould. The former hatch their eggs in hillocks contrived
to retain during the night, amid their warm vegetable linings, the solar
heat of each successive day. The nests of one family are about a yard
high and three wide. In another family, mounds of five yards in height
and twelve in girth seem not uncommon; and the circumference of one
mound in particular measured full fifty yards. These larger mounds are
the work of many birds, through many years, and their firm sides are
covered by ancient forest growth.
</p>
<p>
The bower birds construct over-arching alleys of curved branches,
decorated with pretty grasses, gay feathers, shells and bones, particularly
near the entrances. These bowers seem to be used as meeting and
recreation places for both sexes. They vary to some extent amongst the
different species of this singular tribe.
</p>
<p>
There can be no doubt of the power of adaptation among animals;&mdash;and
those who study them most are least surprised at its extent. Horses
will learn to go up and down stairs, cats to undo door latches; and one
pony mentioned by Jesse used to unfasten the stable door, open and rob
the corn chest. Still more curious, is the American bird called <i>neuntödter</i>,
which catches grasshoppers and spears them upon twigs, not for
the shamble-purposes of the butcher bird, but simply as baits to catch
and eat the smaller birds attracted by the spoil.
</p>
<p>
Schleiden (<cite>Plant</cite> 232), tells a most singular story of a Kangaroo who
tried to drown his pursuer, and shewed considerable craft in the way he
set about the drowning. After knocking the hunter backwards into a
pond, the "old man" (Australian for Kangaroo) kept pushing the poor
fellow's head under water every time he raised it up. If Kangaroo had
never drowned a human being before, he must have proceeded by
analogy, and argued, as some Naturalists do, from the brute to the man.
A dog, mentioned by Jesse, endeavoured to save his drowning master's
life by the reverse process to Kangaroo's, and would not let the beloved
head disappear under water for many a wintry hour after life had been
extinguished. (<cite>Country Life</cite>, p. 119.)
</p>
<p>
A person reflecting on these and similar facts, does not feel much
surprised at Aristotle's appreciation of animal intelligence, (<i>e. g.</i>, <cite>Historiæ</cite>
viii. 1, 2,) "[Greek: hôs gar en anthrôpô technê kai sophia kai synesis, houtôs eniois tôn zôôn
esti tis hetera toiautê physikê dynamis.]" The animal power of adaptation,
travelling beyond the routine of instinctive action, probably struck the
philosopher very strongly.</p></div>

grasps at Wholes, so that in a certain way, the general may seem to take

a father or mother to them. See <cite>Phys. Ausc.</cite> I. 1, with Pacius' note.
The old commentator unties a knot which some moderns appear to have
tied fast again.
</p>
<p>
<em>>Addition.</em> Aristotle's illustration, it is alleged (<i>e. g.</i> by Dr. Whewell),
goes in the wrong direction; fathers and mothers are less comprehensive
terms than men and women; the truth seems to be that children fail to
perceive the differences between parents and other human beings;&mdash;therefore
they call men and women, parents. Pacius says:&mdash;"Nunc igitur totum
esse nobis notius, probat à signo, id est, argumento sumto ab infantibus,
qui initiò non distinguunt patrem ab aliis viris, nec matrem ab aliis
mulieribus: postea verò distinguunt: nempe, quia ab initio habuerunt
cognitionem magis confusam, neque cognoverunt proprietates parentis,
sed tantum eum noverunt sub ratione universali, quatenus est homo,
ideoque non potuerunt eum ab aliis hominibus sejungere. Postea verò
progredientes ad cognitionem magis particularem, possunt patrem ab
aliis discernere." Ed. 1608, p. 346.</p></div>

first dawn, give rise to a very wide difference between the highest animal
instincts, and the lowest instinctive impulses of Man. The discussion
would be far too extensive for these pages; but it is obvious that such
a difference might clearly account for much that is obscure in the
twilight territory of Mind.
</p>
<p>
Hume, however, appears to have thought otherwise, as may be perceived
in the Conclusion of his <cite>Reason of Animals</cite>. From his mention
of "experimental reasoning" and the instances adduced, he would seem
to attribute our Inductive process to a <em>simple</em> instinct. He writes thus:&mdash;"Though
animals learn many parts of their knowledge from observation,
there are also many parts of it which they derive from the original
hand of Nature, which much exceed the share of capacity they possess
on ordinary occasions, and in which they improve little or nothing, by
the longest practice and experience. These we denominate <span class="smcap">Instincts</span>,
and are so apt to admire as something very extraordinary and inexplicable
by all the disquisitions of human understanding. But our wonder
will perhaps cease or diminish when we consider that the experimental
reasoning itself, which we possess in common with beasts, and on which
the whole conduct of life depends, is nothing but a species of instinct or
mechanical power, that acts in us unknown to ourselves, and in its chief
operations is not directed by any such relations or comparison of ideas
as are the proper objects of our intellectual faculties. Though the
instinct be different, yet still it is an instinct, which teaches a man to
avoid the fire, as much as that which teaches a bird, with such exactness,
the art of incubation, and the whole economy and order of its nursery."

kept the two fields of thought apart, and applied to each a criticism unsparing,
but appropriate. Nothing could be more decisive than the result,
though darkened in some degree by the critic's peculiar technicalities.
Moral truth was placed upon the most sublime of elevations. Speculative
reason could never rise beyond the limits of conditioned truth; any
attempt to extend its sphere issued in antinomy or blank negation. It
left the human mind apparently oscillating between Idealism and limited
Insight. But to this must be added a most important point too commonly
forgotten. Though Speculative reason does not demonstrably prove, it
renders <em>conceivable</em> by us those highest of all Ideas which our Practical
reason shews to be necessarily and unquestionably <em>certain</em> for every one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">of us. Moral Truth thus opens to Man's eye a clear vista into the Timeless</span><br />
and the Absolute, to an immortal life beyond the grave, and to God
the Sovereign both of Nature and of Man. It tells us the secret of true
Causation, and with it of all that is most worth living for, the intrinsically
greatest and Best of Humanity. And it binds every human being, as by
golden links, to that ever present Divine throne, the shrine and oracle
set up within his own breast. We ought always to remember that upon
those grand truths which if practically certain cannot be ultimately false,
Kant staked his all. They were the crown alike of his labours and his
life.
</p>
<p>
<em>Addition.</em>&mdash;By these remarks the present writer does not intend subscribing
to all the Kantian conclusions respecting pure Speculative Reason,
much less to those that have been asserted by many of Kant's disciples.
Difference of opinion on such conclusions cannot, however, effect an
honest appreciation of the clear and elevated principles maintained by
Kant on the subject of independent Morality, as contradistinguished
from the scheme which used to be termed Selfish, but is now commonly
called Utilitarian.&mdash;See pp. 93-6 <i>ante</i>.</p></div>

in lively colours, as follows:&mdash;"O my friend, you would do me most
grievous wrong, if you thought my heart empty of those feelings which
make man the standing miracle of Nature. If your child fell into the
river, would you stop to tell or think how you loved it, how dear and
winsome and precious it was to you, how blank your home and bruised
your heart would be without it? Or would you plunge into the stream
in utter recklessness of your life, bear it swiftly out of the devouring
flood, and then in silence strain the rescued little one to your bosom?
Characters differ. It is mine to act, as well as to feel. What, do
you imagine, prompts a thinker to give his days and nights to the rescue
of man's faith in God, his heart-trust and moral inspiration and spiritual
joy, when all these are put in jeopardy by the increase of a knowledge
that is but half comprehended, even by those who in their own special
lines are nobly increasing it? What lies back of the intense activity
of his brain, as he toils over problems that wring the beads from
his brow, gives up to the lonely pursuit of truth the hours that might
be fertile of the prizes clutched after by the crowd, and turns his back
on prizes that even he holds dear? What but a mighty hunger for
God can explain this weary, unending search for Him? What else can
explain the unthanked effort to make plain a path to Him that no man
wants to travel?" American <cite>Index</cite>, Jan. 15, 1874.</p></div>

<p>
Savery's patent (the first granted for a steam engine), is dated 1698.
Papin suggested in 1695 a partial vacuum under a piston for raising
water, so as to make the pressure of the air the moving power. Most
people are aware of the effect upon invention produced by the great
mining interest,&mdash;the necessity of pumping out underground <em>adits</em>, water
logged, and therefore inaccessible.</p>

<p>
Hulls' was the first attempt to convert the reciprocating movement of
the piston-rod into rotation; and it does not rival the crank in simplicity.
But there is a contrivance for equalizing the first irregular motion by
weights, which possesses real beauty, and has the further advantage of
readily increasing or diminishing the velocity of the wheels. The wheels
themselves are fixed at some little distance astern of his boat which he
intends to be used for towing ships. They are thus (as Professor Rigaud
observes) nearer "to what may be considered as the centre of the compound
body, which they were the means of propelling."
</p>
<p>
Such was the earliest patent; but proposals for the same object had
been made still earlier. Papin submitted one to the Royal Society in
1708, comprehending a "boat to be rowed with oars moved with heat,"
and engines capable of throwing bullets and raising water. Sir Isaac
Newton reported on the invention and recommended experiments, but
the Society could not or would not grant a sum not exceeding £15 for
the purpose. Again, the Acta Eruditorum for 1690, preserves a previous
proposal made by Papin, accounts of which will be found in Farey's
<cite>Treatise on the Steam Engine</cite>, and Professor Rigaud's <cite>Early Proposals
for Steam Navigation</cite>. In the latter publication (a paper read to the
Ashmolean Society) is also contained (pp. 11-14) a summary of the most
wonderful among all records relating to this subject;&mdash;the trial of Blasco
de Garay's steam-boat at Barcelona under Charles V. "The experiment
was made the 17th June 1543 on board a vessel called the Trinidad, of
200 barrels burden, which had lately arrived with wheat from Colibre.
The vessel was seen at a given moment to move forward and turn about
at pleasure, without sail, or oar, or human agency, and without any
visible mechanism except a huge boiler of hot water, and a complicated
combination of wheels and paddles." The entire or partial credibility of
this record has been often argued <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>. Professor Rigaud thinks
it "not impossible that even a magnificent invention, like this, may
have sunk into oblivion." Perhaps not, considering that the Spain of
Cervantes is the Spain of Southey, and Mr. Borrow. A clock may stand
still, but a nation which does so is retrograde.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_AL_224" id="Footnote_AL_224"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AL_224"><span class="label">[al]</span></a> The term "relativity" is employed here on account of its breadth
and comprehensiveness, and because it does not imply the adoption of
some special hypothesis as to the essence of things or formative principles
themselves;&mdash;such theorizing being no necessary condition of the present
line of thought.
</p>
<p>
Let it be observed, however, that any law of the natural world by virtue
of which, the apprehended relativity becomes operative, must be conceived
as in its own nature <em>genetic</em> or <em>causative</em>, in order to explain Production.
What is here meant may easily be understood by a few common-sense
reflections.
</p>
<p>
The word "Law" is one of the most ambiguous expressions possible.
Perhaps its most familiar use is in statistical science, where it usually
means the result gained from averages. For example, birth-rates, death-rates,
and rates of exchange are spoken of as laws of increase, of mortality,
and of the money market. Sometimes nothing but the generalized fact is
signified; sometimes it is intended to imply that these formulæ govern,
or ought to govern social questions, or problems of political economy.
</p>
<p>
In like manner, when a law is the verbal embodiment of any principle,
it may be considered as a perfectly abstract proposition; or else as a
governing rule or maxim, under which definite and actual cases can be
brought. The principles of arithmetic or geometry are laws to which
every practical question involving number or measurement must be
submitted. The laws of thought govern our reasonings, or at least they
ought to do so.
</p>
<p>
Another way of looking at Law is to consider it in its commonest origin&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
as the expression of a law-maker's will. But when a writer on
Natural Theology speaks of the laws of the physical world, and then adds
that "law implies a lawgiver," he either supposes himself to have demonstrated
the applicability of this maxim in relation to his own science;&mdash;or
if not he is simply assuming the whole question at issue. [Compare
<i>Additional Note</i> B, to Chapter II. p. 98, <i>seq.</i>]
</p>
<p>
The remaining most usual employment of the word, is to designate a
<em>Force</em>, some actual moving power tending to realize itself in some way,
working out a function either for good or evil, developing the secret of its
own existence by the effects which it produces.
</p>
<p>
Take an example from real life. A medical man coming to a certain
rural district, observed its high death-rate, traced it to the very great
prevalence of small-pox in the place, and formulated a law embodying the
results of several years <em>averages</em> which appeared sufficiently surprising. A
further acquaintance with the habits of the neighbourhood disclosed the
fact that inoculation was continually practised, and as continually kept
secret on account of the penalties attached to it. The inquirer took
advantage of the opportunity afforded by a custom he could not control
to investigate its consequences. A few years later, he arrived at exact
conclusions determining the law of activity exerted by the virus, under
certain conditions. In other words, he found the <em>genetic</em> law of its
operation.
</p>
<p>
Now, if the death-rate,&mdash;a piece of statistical law,&mdash;be contrasted with
this last named law of virus-growth, the difference between these two
formulæ is at once obvious. Without any scientific discussion or refining,
we grasp a broad common-sense distinction, which is all that seems needed
here. For our purpose, it would be useless to inquire whether the law of
virus-growth may be resolved into laws higher and far more recondite still.
An inventor seizing the useful law he wants, will not stop to ask any such
questions; he will apply his power and realize the function he has in
view at the moment.
</p>
<p>
Another common-sense instance is to think of the properties of any
familiar substance; the acridity of an alkali, for instance; its power of
effervescing with acids, and neutralizing them; its behaviour as a reagent
in a variety of ways, long to enumerate, but practically useful. When we
have described all these properties, have we defined the whole substance?
In other words, is the alkali anything more than a bundle of properties
momentarily known to us? Undoubtedly there is one point more to be
noticed; its principle of <em>permanence</em>, until brought under new conditions
which dissolve its unity, and destroy the inter-coherence of its properties.
Now whatever maintains this unity is the law of its substance. There
are laws of nature under which both it and countless other substances are
formed, continue, and are dissolved, making way for unending series of
fresh combinations. And this mode of apprehending the unities we call
substances, raises the self-same idea of genetic law which has been under
consideration. If we are asked whether we can explain such laws further,
we usually reply by saying "these are the forces of the natural world."
Their correlations and modifications rule the kingdom of nature, and the
great globe itself;&mdash;nay, they wield the empire of the Universe!
</p>
<p>
Such laws, such forces, have engrossed the attention of physical philosophers
from the rude beginnings of inquiry. They have led to speculations
of all kinds;&mdash;the best known of which is the distinction between
Form and Matter in existing objects;&mdash;a distinction in common use
amongst persons who but dimly guess at the past issues which it raises.
Nothing, however, can be said on such a topic here, except by way of
reference to the philosophic system of Francis Bacon. [Compare p. 92
<i>ante</i>, and the Synopsis prefixed to this chapter.]</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_AM_225" id="Footnote_AM_225"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AM_225"><span class="label">[am]</span></a> One of the most curious <i lang="fr">morceaux</i> in the history of Science, is the
fact that the nature of Heat has been several times thus determined, viz.,
by Bacon, Locke, and Count Rumford. See Tyndall on <cite>Heat as a Mode
of Motion</cite>, Section II., and Appendix.
</p>
<p>
Bacon determines the nature of Heat by way of exemplifying "The
Investigation of Forms." It is his sole instance, and is most instructive.
(<cite>Nov. Org.</cite> II., 11 seq., in E. and S. Vol. IV., pp. 127-155.) "For
example," he begins, "let the investigation be into the Form of Heat."
It need scarcely be observed that the twofold relation of his "Forms" to
Metaphysic and to Physic is one of the least explained parts of Bacon's
vast system. How little his theory of Induction is commonly understood
may be perceived by any skilled reader of Macaulay's well known Essay&mdash;a
composition (to borrow a great schoolmaster's words) "displaying an
almost inconceivable amount of nescience."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_187_226" id="Footnote_187_226"></a><a href="#FNanchor_187_226"><span class="label">[187]</span></a> It is worth observation how often the abstract entity&mdash;(the principle
of the whole realization)&mdash;is forgotten even by scientific persons. Forgotten,
we say, since surely forgetfulness is the true origin of many futile
attempts at explaining away essential principles. The following very
curious case in point is narrated by S. T. Coleridge:&mdash;"There is still
preserved in the Royal Observatory at Richmond the model of a bridge,
constructed by the late justly celebrated Mr. Atwood (at that time, however,
in the decline of life), in the confidence that he had explained the
wonderful properties of the arch as resulting from the compound action of
simple wedges, or of the rectilinear solids of which the material arch was
composed; and of which supposed discovery his model was to exhibit
ocular proof. Accordingly, he took a sufficient number of wedges of
brass highly polished. Arranging these at first on a skeleton arch of
wood, he then removed this scaffolding or support; and the bridge not
only stood firm, without any cement between the squares, but he could
take away any given portion of them, as a third or a half, and appending
a correspondent weight, at either side, the remaining part stood as before.
Our venerable sovereign, who is known to have had a particular interest
and pleasure in all works and discoveries of mechanic science or ingenuity,
looked at it for awhile stedfastly, and, as his manner was, with quick and
broken expressions of praise and courteous approbation, in the form of
answers to his own questions. At length turning to the constructor, he
said, 'But Mr. Atwood, you have presumed the figure. You have put
the arch first in this wooden skeleton. Can you build a bridge of the
same wedges in any other figure? A straight bridge, or with two lines
touching at the apex? If not, is it not evident that the bits of brass
derive their continuance in the present position from the property of the
arch, and not the arch from the property of the wedge?' The objection
was fatal, the justice of the remark not to be resisted."&mdash;(<cite>The Friend.</cite>
Vol. III., pp. 176, 7.)
</p>
<p>
<i>Addition.</i> Of "those abstract entities absolute in truth," Bacon
writes (<cite>Nov. Org.</cite> II. 9), "Let the investigation of Forms, which are (in
the eye of reason at least, and in their essential law) eternal and immutable,
constitute <em>Metaphysics</em>:" and again (Ibid. 15), "To God, truly, the
Giver and Architect of Forms, and it may be to the angels and higher
intelligences, it belongs to have an affirmative knowledge of forms immediately,
and from the first contemplation. But this assuredly is more
than man can do, to whom it is granted only to proceed at first by
negatives, and at last to end in affirmatives, after exclusion has been
exhausted." And of their utility, as applied truths, he says (Ibid. 2),
"Though in nature nothing really exists beside individual bodies,
performing pure individual acts according to a fixed law, yet in philosophy
this very law, and the investigation, discovery, and explanation of it, is
the foundation as well of knowledge as of operation. And it is this law,
with its clauses, that I mean when I speak of <em>Forms</em>; a name which I the
rather adopt because it has grown into use and become familiar."
</p>
<p>
And these passages are in perfect harmony with Bacon's precept "that
Physic should handle that which supposeth in Nature only a being and
moving (and natural necessity), and Metaphysic should handle that which
supposeth further in nature a reason, understanding, and platform
(ideam)." (<cite>Advancement.</cite> II. E. and S. p. 353.) The reader will also perceive
how natural it was for Bacon to place mathematical science "as a
branch of metaphysic; for the subject of it being Quantity; not Quantity
indefinite, which is but a relative and belongeth to <i lang="la">philosophia prima</i> (as
hath been said,) but Quantity determined or proportionable; it appeareth
to be one of the Essential Forms of things; as that that is causative in
nature of a number of effects; ... and it is true also that of all other
forms (as we understand forms) it is the most abstracted and separable
from matter, and therefore most proper to metaphysic; which hath likewise
been the cause why it hath been better laboured and enquired than
any of the other forms, which are more immersed into matter. For it
being the nature of the mind of man (to the extreme prejudice of knowledge)
to delight in the spacious liberty of generalities, as in a champion
region, and not in the inclosures of particularity; the mathematics of all
other knowledge were the goodliest fields to satisfy that appetite." (Ibid.
p. 359.) Compare this <cite>Essay</cite>, p. 91 <i>ante</i>, together with foot-note.</p></div>

which the general diffusion of knowledge produces on society at large;
how it draws the different classes of it into more free communication with
each other; how its tendency is to make the laws more impartial, bring
even the most despotic governments under the influence of public opinion,
and show them that they have no real security except in the good will of
the people. Knowledge goes hand-in-hand with civilization. It is necessary
to the giving full effect to the precepts of the Christian faith. It
was from the want of it that Galileo was tortured by the Inquisition, that
Servetus was burned by Calvin, that the Huguenots were persecuted and
slaughtered by Louis XIV., and that in numerous other instances one
sect of Christians has conceived it to be their duty to exterminate another.
It is a misapplication of the term civilization to apply it to any form of
society in which ignorance is the rule and knowledge the exception. If a
Being of superior intelligence were to look down from some higher sphere
on our doings here on the earth, is it to be supposed that he would regard
the Duke of Buckingham, dancing at the French Court, and scattering the
pearls with which his dress was ornamented, on the floor, as being really
superior to an Australian savage; or that he would see in the foreign
Prince, who at a later period exhibited himself at another Court with his
boots glittering with diamonds, any better emblem of civilization than in
the negro chief, who gratifies his vanity by strutting about in the cast-off

animals, and partly by breeding through select specimens of each race.
The two principles thus relied on are habit and heredity. Respecting the
latter of these a note of considerable length had been intended in this
place. But the reader interested in the general question can learn sufficient
details in Dr. Carpenter's <cite>Mental Physiology</cite> together with the
authorities therein referred to by him.
</p>
<p>
The following instances adduced by Mr. Wallace to show how
improvement through heredity is visibly limited are very remarkable.
"In the matter of speed, a limit of a definite kind as regards land
animals does exist in nature. All the swiftest animals&mdash;deer, antelopes,
hares, foxes, lions, leopards, horses, zebras, and many others&mdash;have
reached very nearly the same degree of speed. Although the swiftest of
each must have been for ages preserved, and the slowest must have
perished, we have no reason to believe there is any advance of speed.
The possible limit under existing conditions, and perhaps under possible
terrestrial conditions, has been long ago reached." He immediately
proceeds to place in contrast with these, some examples where progress is
not thus barred. "In cases, however, where this limit had not been so
nearly reached as in the horse, we have been enabled to make a more
marked advance and to produce a greater difference of form. The wild
dog is an animal that hunts much in company, and trusts more to
endurance than to speed. Man has produced the greyhound, which
differs much more from the wolf or the dingo than the racer does from
the wild Arabian. Domestic dogs, again, have varied more in size and in
form than the whole family of Canidæ in a state of Nature. No wild
dog, fox, or wolf, is either so small as some of the smallest terriers and
spaniels, or so large as the largest varieties of hound or Newfoundland
dog. And, certainly, no two wild animals of the family differ so widely in
form and proportions as the Chinese pug and the Italian greyhound, or
the bulldog and the common greyhound. The known range of variation
is, therefore, more than enough for the derivation of all the forms of
Dogs, Wolves, and Foxes from a common ancestor." Wallace. <cite>Natural
Selection</cite>, pp. 292, 3.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Prichard's accounts of similar variations in his <cite>Natural History of
Man</cite> and other ethnological works are particularly interesting.
</p>
<p>
Habit is a topic more germane to the subject of self-training, and is
therefore examined at some length in our text.
</p>
<p>
It seems natural that the empire of both Habit and Heredity should be
strongest over the purely automatous, and the instinctive or semi-instinctive
actions of mankind. Witness the effect of Caste institutions, Guilds,
and family vocations. Regular occupation struck a certain visitor to this
world as producing a like result:&mdash;

that, following Telesius in this as in some other respects, he adopted as a
doctrine the duality of the human soul. He maintains it at length in the
<cite>De Augmentis</cite> iv. 3, a chapter which begins thus:&mdash;"Let us now proceed
to the doctrine which concerns the Human Soul, from the treasures
whereof all other doctrines are derived. The parts thereof are two; the
one treats of the rational soul, which is divine; the other of the irrational,
which is common with brutes.... Now this soul (as it exists in man) is
only the instrument of the rational soul, and has its origin like that of
the brutes in the dust of the earth.... For there are many and great
excellencies of the human soul above the souls of brutes, manifest even to
those who philosophise according to the sense. Now wherever the mark
of so many and great excellencies is found, there also a specific difference
ought to be constituted; and therefore I do not much like the confused
and promiscuous manner in which philosophers have handled the
functions of the soul; as if the human soul differed from the spirit of
brutes in degree rather than in kind; as the sun differs from the stars,
or gold from metals."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_AT_238" id="Footnote_AT_238"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AT_238"><span class="label">[at]</span></a> The problem awaiting the philosophic physicist runs as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen how closely and with what degree of distinctness,
science can approximate these impalpable forces governing the natural
world, to the forces we are accustomed to call immaterial, because they
become known to us by the activities of Thought and Will.
</p>
<p>
This problem&mdash;the incorporeity of Matter, or a near approach to it&mdash;has
been a favourite subject of speculation in all ages. The curious reader
may track it from the pre-and post-Christian Greeks through Arabian
and Jewish philosophies to the Schoolmen (who borrowed from Jews
unknowingly) and so transmitted it down like an heirloom to our own
later controversialists. The subject has been treated on Metaphysical
grounds, for Religious interests, or as a weapon keen edged in demolishing
antagonistic cosmologies. But it has not often been entertained for
purely scientific reasons, and as one of those so-called "useless questions"
which always turn out most prolific seminal principles, fertile in
explaining nature and throwing out branches in numerous unforeseen
directions.
</p>
<p>
It was thus however and with no side views that the illustrious
Faraday looked at this subject. With what effect may be best learned
by putting together two separate accounts of his reasoning.
</p>
<p>
In 1844, Dr. Bence Jones informs us Faraday (then in his 53rd year)
indulged in "A speculation respecting that view of the nature of matter
which considers its ultimate atoms as centres of force, and <em>not as so
many little bodies surrounded by forces</em>.... The particle, indeed,
is supposed to exist only by these forces, and where they are it is."
</p>
<p>
This speculation did in fact give a tone to that memorable season&mdash;now
thirty years ago.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Tyndall says:&mdash;"On Friday, January 19, 1844, he opened the
weekly evening meetings of the Royal Institution by a discourse entitled
'A speculation touching Electric Conduction and the nature of Matter.'
In this discourse he not only attempts the overthrow of Dalton's Theory
of Atoms, but also the subversion of all ordinary scientific ideas regarding
the nature and relations of Matter and Force. He objected to the
use of the term atom:&mdash;'I have not yet found a mind,' he says, 'that
did habitually separate it from its accompanying temptations; and there
can be no doubt that the words definite proportions, equivalent, primes,
etc., which did and do fully express all the <em>facts</em> of what is usually
called the atomic theory in chemistry, were dismissed because they were
not expressive enough, and did not say all that was in the mind of
him who used the word atom in their stead,'" (<cite>Faraday as a Discoverer</cite>,
pp. 119-20.)
</p>
<p>
And again:&mdash;"With his usual courage and sincerity he pushes his
view to its utmost consequences. 'This view of the constitution of
matter,' he continues, 'would seem to involve necessarily the conclusion
that matter fills all space, or at least all space to which gravitation
extends; for gravitation is a property of matter dependent on a certain
force, and it is this force which constitutes the matter. In that view
matter is not merely mutually penetrable; but each atom extends, so to
say, throughout the whole of the solar system, yet always retaining
its own centre of force.'" Faraday "compares the interpenetration of
two atoms to the coalescence of two distinct waves, which though for a
moment blended to a single mass, preserve their individuality, and afterwards
separate." (<cite>Ibid.</cite> pp. 123-4 and note.)
</p>
<p>
The subject did not easily lose its hold on the philosopher's mind.
"At the Institution," writes Dr. Bence Jones, "he gave eight lectures
after Easter on the phenomena and philosophy of heat. He ended this
course thus:&mdash;'We know nothing about matter but its forces&mdash;nothing
in the creation but the effect of these forces; further our sensations and
perceptions are not fitted to carry us; all the rest, which we may conceive
we know, is only imagination.' He gave two Friday discourses:
the first on the nature of matter, the other on recent improvements in
the silvering of mirrors.
</p>
<p>
"His notes of the first lecture begin thus:&mdash;'Speculations dangerous
temptations; generally avoid them; but a time to speculate as well as to
refrain, all depends upon the temper of the mind. I was led to consider
the nature of space in relation to electric conduction, and so of matter,
<i>i.e.</i> whether <em>continuous</em> or consisting of <em>particles with intervening space</em>,
according to its supposed constitution. Consider this point, <em>remarking
the assumptions everywhere</em>.
</p>
<p>
"'<em>Chemical considerations</em> abundant, but almost all <em>assumption</em>. Easy
to speak of atomic proportions, multiple proportions, isomeric and isomorphic
phenomena and compound bases; and to account for effects we
have only to hang on to assumed atoms the properties or arrangement of
properties assumed to be sufficient for the purpose. But the fundamental
and main facts are expressed by the term <em>definite proportion</em>,&mdash;the
rest, including the atomic notion, is assumption.
</p>
<p>
"'The view that physical chemistry necessarily takes of atoms is now
very large and complicated; first many elementary atoms&mdash;next compound
and complicated atoms. System within system, like the starry
heavens, <em>may be right</em>&mdash;but may <em>be all wrong</em>. Thus see how little of
general theory of matter is known as fact, and how <em>much</em> is assumption.
</p>
<p>
"'Final brooding impression, that particles are only centres of force;
that the force or forces constitute the matter; that therefore there is
no space between the particles distinct from the particles of matter;
that they touch each other just as much in gases as in liquids or solids;
and that they are materially penetrable, probably even to their very
centres. That, for instance, water is not two particles of oxygen side by
side, but two spheres of power mutually penetrated, and the centres even
coinciding.'" Bence Jones&mdash;Life of Faraday, Vol. II., pp. 177-78.
</p>
<p>
These views (best known as Boscovich's theory), though not generally
held in scientific circles, are favoured by Bacon's most able commentator,
Robert Leslie Ellis, and are pronounced by Professor
Huxley a "tenable hypothesis." Mr. Spencer poises the balance
as follows:&mdash;"Though the combining weights of the respective elements
are termed by chemists their 'equivalents,' for the purpose
of avoiding a questionable assumption, we are unable to think of the
combination of such definite weights, without supposing it to take place
between definite numbers of definite particles. And thus it would
appear that the Newtonian view is at any rate preferable to that of
Boscovich. A disciple of Boscovich, however, may reply that his
master's theory is involved in that of Newton; and cannot indeed be
escaped. 'What,' he may ask, 'is it that holds together the parts of
these ultimate atoms?' 'A cohesive force,' his opponent must answer.
'And what,' he may continue, 'is it that holds together the parts of any
fragments, into which, by sufficient force, an ultimate atom might be
broken?' Again the answer must be&mdash;a cohesive force. 'And what,'
he may still ask, 'if the ultimate atom were, as we can imagine it to be,
reduced to parts as small in proportion to it, as it is in proportion to a
tangible mass of matter&mdash;what must give each part the ability to sustain
itself, and to occupy space?' Still there is no answer but&mdash;a cohesive
force. Carry the process in thought as far as we may, until the extension
of the parts is less than can be imagined, we still cannot escape the
admission of forces by which the extension is upheld; and we can find no
limit until we arrive at the conception of centres of force without any
extension." <cite>First Principles</cite>, p. 54.
</p>
<p>
It is evident that Faraday was able to think in a manner which has been
often declared impossible. Mr. Spencer's statement of the counter case is
alone sufficient to prove that the inquiry is sure to be recurrent. We
may add with Dr. Tyndall that facts alone cannot satisfy the mind, and
that when a law is established, the question "why" is inevitable. Compare
<i>foot-note</i> p. 324 <i>post</i>.</p></div>

to some readers a clearer idea of their nature than many careful explanations.
Three balks of timber are lying in our road,&mdash;one, a very
large and heavy monster, directly across it. Desirous of driving by, and
being without adequate help to remove an obstacle beyond our strength,
we call to mind the following definition. "The lever is an inflexible bar,
capable of free motion about a fixed axis, called the fulcrum." (Newth.
<cite>Natural Philosophy</cite>, p. 33.) Acting upon this idea, we place one balk we
can manage to move, upon a second which happens to lie conveniently,
and so roll away the third heavy monster. This done, we replace No. 1
peaceably beside No. 2, and wend on our way rejoicing. Now the lever,
as defined by Newth, existed ideally in our mind, and we realised and
used it. Our lever and fulcrum are still lying on the road, though they
are lever and fulcrum no longer. The leverage was an applied mental
Form, but we no longer want the Form to be operative,&mdash;and along
with it the Force has disappeared.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AU_240" id="Footnote_AU_240"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AU_240"><span class="label">[au]</span></a> Our knowledge of Matter and of Motion;&mdash;our knowledge of their
continuance while our forms and other forms are undergoing change;&mdash;all
we most <em>certainly</em> know of the material world, resolves itself into our
knowledge of Force. Thus far Mr. Herbert Spencer is with us, as may
be seen from the following paragraphs from his <cite>First Principles</cite>. "By
the indestructibility of Matter, we really mean the indestructibility of the
<em>force</em> with which Matter affects us. As we become conscious of Matter
only through that resistance which it opposes to our muscular energy, so
do we become conscious of the permanence of Matter only through the
permanence of this resistance; as either immediately or mediately proved
to us. And this truth is made manifest not only by analysis of the <i lang="la">à
posteriori</i> cognition, but equally so by analysis of the <i lang="la">à priori</i> one. For
that which we cannot conceive to be diminished by the continued compression
of Matter, is not its occupancy of space, but its ability to resist."
(p. 179.) "It remains to be pointed out that the continuity of Motion,
as well as the indestructibility of Matter, is really known to us in terms
of <i>force</i>. That a certain manifestation of force remains for ever undiminished,
is the ultimate content of the thought; whether reached
<i lang="la">à posteriori</i> or <i lang="la">à priori</i>." (p. 182.) And again (pp. 191-2). "What, in
these two foregoing chapters, was proved true of Matter and Motion,
is, <i lang="la">à fortiori</i>, true of the Force out of which our conceptions of Matter
and Motion are built. Indeed, as we saw, that which is indestructible
in matter and motion, is the force they present. And, as we here see,
the truth that Force is indestructible, is the obverse of the truth that
the Unknown Cause of the changes going on in consciousness is indestructible.
So that the persistence of consciousness, constitutes at once
our immediate experience of the persistence of Force, and imposes on
us the necessity we are under of asserting its persistence....
Consciousness without this or that particular <i>form</i> is possible; but consciousness
without <i>contents</i> is impossible."
</p>
<p>
We are also quite at one with Mr. Herbert Spencer as regards an assertion
made in his <cite>Principles of Psychology</cite> (I. 161,) and repeated, to shew
how anti-materialistic he is, in his last book. (<cite>Essays</cite>, III., p. 250.) "Of
the two it seems easier to translate so-called Matter into so-called Spirit,
than to translate so-called Spirit into so-called Matter, which latter is,
indeed, wholly impossible."
</p>
<p>
But though it is true, as he adds, that "no <i>translation</i> can carry us
beyond our symbols," it is no less true that we are impelled to inquire
into that which underlies them. Mr. Spencer says further (<cite>Psychology</cite> I.
162,) "The conditioned form under which Being is presented in the
Subject, cannot, any more than the conditioned form under which Being
is presented in the Object, be the Unconditioned Being common to the
two." In this negation we are less at one with him, for, as we firmly
believe, in that conditioned sphere we call our own subjective nature there
is a Reality presented to our consciousness by every act of Volition which
brings us far nearer than any objective or outside form of existence can
bring us to that Unconditioned Being which is common to the two, and
infinitely superior to them both.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_AV_244" id="Footnote_AV_244"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AV_244"><span class="label">[av]</span></a> Or else as some may prefer to state it, Mind <i>is</i> the intelligible law.
In other words, Law is the manifestation and energizing of the Mind in
Nature, and we recognize mind in the energy of Law. Canon Mozley
spoke as follows in 1872. "There is a great deal said now about Mind
in Nature, and scientific men talk enthusiastically about Mind; the old
notion of chance is obsolete, and in spite of the strength of a materialist
school, there is a tendency to a consensus of scientific men that there is
Mind in the universe. Would any one in any public meeting of scientific
men dare to stand up and <i>deny</i> that there was Mind in Nature? It would
be thought monstrous. It would be set down as the revival of an old
stupidity. It is the only form in which they find they can speak of nature
which at all ennobles it or which satisfies their own idea of the sublimity
of nature." <cite>The Principle of Causation considered in opposition to Atheistic
Theories</cite>, p. 41.
</p>
<p>
The learned writer goes on to connect this admitted idea of Mind with
the collateral idea of Design. And this is a most natural sequence of
thought. But, for reasons already mentioned, the main argument of this
chapter pursues another track. Mind in Nature being directly intuited,
(to use an expressive Kantian phrase) we supplement the evidence thus
given by a cross-examination of facts for the purpose of eliciting an
account of what manner of Intelligence this Mind in Nature must be.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AW_245" id="Footnote_AW_245"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AW_245"><span class="label">[aw]</span></a> "It is true," says Canon Mozley, "that matter has lately been set
before us as claiming more vicinity to mind than it has been usual to
assign it; and a scientific man, of the highest genius, has regretted that
'mind and matter have ever been presented to us in the rudest contrast&mdash;the
one as all noble, the other as all vile.' ... Hobbes, in the 17th
century, anticipated this claim, and laid down 'that all matter as matter
is endued not only with figure and a capacity of motion, but also with an
actual sense and perception, and wants only the organs and memory of
animals to express its sensations,'" <cite>On Causation</cite>, as before, p. 38.
</p>
<p>
The doctrine of an inferior and irrational, or as some phrase it "a blind
intelligence" is the topic next discussed with some fulness in our text.
</p>
<p>
This "blind intelligence" makes Nature, so to speak, "the instinct of
the Universe." Thence it is "no long step" to a belief that the world is
a living creature, neither are there wanting modern accounts of the
principle of Vitality, and its powers of assimilation,&mdash;equally applicable
to the accretive growth of a crystal.
</p>
<p>
The renovators of philosophy were (as Mr. Leslie Ellis remarks) strongly
inclined to this belief, its typical teacher being Campanella. Leibniz
points out with his usual energy its affinity with the Scholastic doctrine
of "substantial forms"&mdash;(a very different theory from Bacon's) "formas
quasdam substantiales ejusmodi sibi imaginatus videtur, quæ per se sint
causa motus in corporibus, quemadmodum Scholastici capiunt;" and proceeds
to say, "ita reditur ad tot deunculos, quot formas substantiales, et
Gentilem prope polytheismum.... Quum tamen revera in natura nulla
sit sapientia, nullus appetitus, ordo vero pulcher ex eo oriatur, quia est
horologium Dei." <cite>Leibnitii Opera Philosophica</cite>, Ed. Erdmann, pp. 52-3.</p></div>

kind, does not to some thinkers carry with it a perception of Design, is

</p>
<p>
"The absurdity of the <i lang="la">à posteriori</i> argument for a God consists in the
assumption that what we call order, harmony, and adaptation are evidence
of design, when it is evident that, <em>whether there be a God or not,
order, harmony, and adaptation must have existed from eternity, and are not</em>
<em>therefore necessary proof of a designing cause</em>." (<cite>American Index</cite>, Jan.
11, 1873.)

insight enough to perceive that these eternal harmonizers of the whole

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BA_252" id="Footnote_BA_252"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BA_252"><span class="label">[ba]</span></a> With perfect fairness, Professor Huxley admits the force of this
distinction. In a paragraph quoted p. 133, he wrote thus:&mdash;"It is
necessary to remember that there is a wider Teleology, which is not
touched by the doctrine of Evolution, but is actually based upon the
fundamental proposition of Evolution. That proposition is, that the
whole world, living and not living, is the result of the mutual interaction,
according to definite laws, of the forces possessed by the molecules of which
the primitive nebulosity of the universe was composed. If this be true,
it is no less certain that the existing world lay, potentially, in the cosmic
vapour; and that a sufficient intelligence could, from a knowledge of the
properties of the molecules of that vapour, have predicted, say the state
of the Fauna of Britain in 1869, with as much certainty as one can say
what will happen to the vapour of the breath in a cold winter's day."
</p>
<p>
It is curious to compare Mr. Huxley's dictum on the Eye (cited p. 133)
with a passage before part-quoted from Mr. Newman. "In saying that
lungs <em>were intended</em> to breathe, and eyes to see, we imply an argument
from Fitness to Design, which carries conviction to the overwhelming
majority of cultivated as well as uncultivated minds. Yet, in calling it
an argument, we may seem to appeal to the logical faculty; and this
would be an error. No syllogism is pretended, that <em>proves</em> a lung to
have been made to breathe; but <em>we see it</em> by what some call Common-Sense,
and some Intuition. If such a fact stood alone in the universe,
and no other existences spoke of Design, it would probably remain a
mere enigma to us; but when the whole human world is pervaded by
similar instances, not to see a Universal Mind in nature appears almost
a brutal insensibility; and if any one intelligently professes Atheism,
the more acute he is, the more distinctly we perceive that he is deficient
in the Religious Faculty. Just as, if he had no sense of Beauty in anything,
we should not imagine that we could impart it by argument, so
neither here.... No stress whatever needs here to be laid upon
minute anatomy, as, for instance, of the eye: it signifies not, whether
we do or do not understand its optical structure as a matter of science.
If it had <em>no</em> optical structure at all, if it differed in no respect (that we
could discover) from a piece of marble, except that it sees, this would not
impair the reasons for believing that it <em>is meant</em> to see." <cite>The Soul</cite>,
pp. 32-3.
</p>
<p>
This extract from Mr. Newman raises the question&mdash;Is an eminent Biologist
any better judge on the subject of <em>Design</em>, than any other eminent
thinker? Clearly he is a judge of <em>Fitness</em>, but that fact is admitted on all
sides;&mdash;the eyes of animals are practically fit for seeing with, and, what is
more, they are fitted to the special fields of vision useful to their several
owners. The first question is, Does the fact of seeing or the fitness to
see raise a moral certainty or very strong probability of Design? And
should a Biologist rejoin that there exists another account of organic
facts and fitnesses probable and adequate; next comes the further
inquiry, which is the most probable, the most adequate, in a word the
easiest? In this connection it must likewise be asked with some urgency,
what <em>non</em>-Biological reasons there are for preferring Design? Whether
for instance any good reasons may be found for believing that there is
somewhere subsisting in and over the Natural world an Intelligence of
such order as to be capable of arranging fitness with a view to the
harmony and general co-operation of natural Forces?
</p>
<p>
The attempt has been made to shew cause on this side in the present
Chapter. Of course, the case for Design must be rendered unanswerable
if a certitude of Reason, either speculative or practical, or a very strong
conclusion of moral argument, or a probability outweighing all other
probabilities, shall in any way be shewn for accepting the still nobler
belief in a self-existent Will and Personality. Now this latter idea is
the subject of our two closing Chapters, and is contemplated on grounds
with which the Biologist or Physicist, quâ Biologist or Physicist has no
very special concern.
</p>
<p>
It seems plain, however, that when a great Biologist is pre-eminently
a philosophic thinker (as an author like Mr. Huxley must be acknowledged
by competent judges)&mdash;then he possesses a strong vantage ground,
and vast opportunities either for good or for evil. And these last six
words remind us to add with Mr. Newman that after all <em>subjective</em> conditions
must not be forgotten.
</p>
<p>
Would not a man without sense of the Beautiful be "colour-blind" to
many among the harmonies of Nature? And is there not something in
the "Religious insight" Mr. Newman speaks of which seems nothing less
than a gift of vision and faculty divine? Man thus endowed may be in
the highest sense Nature's interpreter, when he sees in her moving
mirror the reflected lineaments of his own and Nature's God. To such
a mind no idea can be more sublimely magnificent than the philosophic
Teleology which Mr. Huxley bases on Evolution; it seems to compress
into one the Past, the Present, and the Future; and to follow with
winged thought that glance of an omniscient Creator which tongues of
men and angels must for ever fail to describe.
</p>
<p>
We ought to add that the principle of Evolution has been defined in
more than one way. Some definitions would exclude the wide Teleologic
view. What is here meant might (to borrow Mr. Spencer's remark) be
more justly characterized as "<span class="smcap">Involution</span>."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_BB_255" id="Footnote_BB_255"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BB_255"><span class="label">[bb]</span></a> How Bacon can have been pictured by his admirers as neither ideal,
nor metaphysical, seems to be one of those unintelligible mysteries of
idolatry which idol-worshippers cannot themselves explain. How impossible
it is on such a supposition to reconcile Bacon with himself will
appear evident to any informed reader of Mr. Ellis's Preface to the
Philosophical Works.
</p>
<p>
Bacon's tribute to Plato was just, as well as discriminating, and to our
purpose is most appropriate. He says (<cite>De Augmentis</cite>, III. 4) "For Metaphysic,
I have already assigned to it the inquiry of Formal and Final
Causes; which assignation, as far as it relates to Forms, may seem
nugatory; because of a received and inveterate opinion that the Essential
Forms or true differences of things cannot by any human diligence be
found out; an opinion which in the meantime implies and admits that
the invention of Forms is of all parts of knowledge the worthiest to be
sought, if it be possible to be found. And as for the possibility of finding
it, they are ill discoverers who think there is no land where they can see
nothing but sea. But it is manifest that Plato, a man of sublime wit
(and one that surveyed all things as from a lofty cliff), did in his doctrine
concerning Ideas descry that Forms were the true object of knowledge;
howsoever he lost the fruit of this most true opinion by considering and
trying to apprehend Forms as absolutely abstracted from matter." This
last path we have endeavoured to avoid; and have ourselves elected to
follow the Baconian precept, and to treat the Law or Form of Production
not logically, but as seen in operation, and existent <i lang="la">in rerum naturâ</i>; not
<i lang="la">in ordine ad hominem</i> but <i lang="la">in ordine ad Universum</i>.
</p>
<p>
What Bacon himself expected from the investigation, he states plainly
enough in continuation. "If we fix our eyes diligently seriously and
sincerely upon action and use, it will not be difficult to discern and
understand what those Forms are the knowledge whereof may wonderfully
enrich and benefit the condition of men.... This part of
Metaphysic I find deficient; whereat I marvel not, because I hold it not
possible that the Forms of things can be invented by that course of
invention hitherto used; the root of the evil, as of all others, being this:
that men have used to sever and withdraw their thoughts too soon and
too far from experience and particulars, and have given themselves
wholly up to their own meditation and arguments.
</p>
<p>
"But the use of this part of Metaphysic, which I reckon amongst the
deficient, is of the rest the most excellent in two respects; the one,
because it is the duty and virtue of all knowledge to abridge the circuits
and long ways of experience (as much as truth will permit), and to
remedy the ancient complaint that 'life is short and art is long.' ...
For God is holy in the multitude of his works, holy in the order or
connexion of them, and holy in the union of them. And therefore the
speculation was excellent in Parmenides and Plato (although in them it
was but a bare speculation), 'that all things by a certain scale ascend
to unity.'" (<cite>Ibid.</cite> Ellis and Spedding, IV. 360-362.)</p></div>

distinct emphasis. Speaking of the Eye as an optical instrument, he says,
"Here are <em>four</em> conditions of things each utterly <em>independent</em> of the others,
viz. the nerve, then its non-reflecting coating, then a transparent medium
investing it, then a most remarkable <em>ether</em> surrounding the whole, the
concurrence of all four being essential to the production of vision, nevertheless
we are to believe that all these adjustments and adaptations are
accidentally made, retained and handed down by inheritance. If there be
not evidence here of the selecting, arranging, controlling power of <em>mind</em>,
will, forethought, contrivance, then I feel that I have no evidence for the
existence of the individuality of my own being." <cite>Analogies</cite>, <i>etc.</i>, p. 124.</p></div>

orifice of the ear, which is closed at the bottom by the circular tympanic
membrane. Behind that membrane is the cavity called the drum of the
ear, this cavity being separated from the space between it and the brain
by a bony partition, in which there are two orifices, the one round and
the other oval. These orifices are also closed by fine membranes. Across
the cavity of the drum stretches a series of four little bones: the first,
called the <em>hammer</em>, is attached to the tympanic membrane; the second,
called the <em>anvil</em>, is connected by a joint with the hammer; a third little
round bone connects the anvil with the <em>stirrup bone</em>, which has its oval
base planted against the membrane of the oval orifice above referred to.
The base of the stirrup bone abuts against this membrane, almost
covering it, and leaving but a narrow rim of the membrane surrounding the
bone. Behind the bony partition, and between it and the brain, we have
the extraordinary organ called the <em>labyrinth</em>, which is filled with water,
and over the lining membrane of which, the terminal fibres of the auditory
nerve are distributed. When the tympanic membrane receives a
shock, that shock is transmitted through the series of bones above referred
to, and is concentrated on the membrane against which the base of the
stirrup bone is planted. That membrane transfers the shock to the water
of the labyrinth, which, in its turn, transfers it to the nerves.
</p>
<p>
"The transmission, however, is not direct. At a certain place within
the labyrinth exceedingly fine elastic bristles, terminating in sharp points,
grow up between the terminal nerve fibres. These bristles, discovered
by Max Schultze, are eminently calculated to sympathise with those
vibrations of the water which correspond to their proper periods. Thrown
thus into vibration, the bristles stir the nerve fibres which lie between
their roots, and excite audition. At another place in the labyrinth we
have little crystalline particles called <em>otolithes</em>&mdash;the Hörsteine of the Germans&mdash;embedded
among the nervous filaments, and which, when they
vibrate, exert an intermittent pressure upon the adjacent nerve fibres,
thus exciting audition. The otolithes probably subserve a different purpose
from that fulfilled by the bristles of Schultze. They are fitted, by
their weight, to accept and prolong the vibrations of evanescent sounds,
which might otherwise escape attention. The bristles of Schultze, on the
contrary, because of their extreme lightness, would instantly yield up an
evanescent motion, while they are eminently fitted for the transmission
of continuous vibrations. Finally, there is in the labyrinth a wonderful
organ, discovered by the Marchese Corti, which is to all appearance a
musical instrument, with its chords so stretched as to accept vibrations
of different periods, and transmit them to the nerve filaments which traverse
the organ. Within the ears of men, and without their knowledge
or contrivance, this lute of 3,000 strings has existed for ages, accepting
the music of the outer world, and rendering it fit for reception by the
brain. Each musical tremor which falls upon this organ selects from its
tensioned fibres the one appropriate to its own pitch, and throws that
fibre into unisonant vibration. And thus, no matter how complicated
the motion of the external air may be, those microscopic strings can
analyse it and reveal the constituents of which it is composed." Tyndall.
<cite>On Sound</cite>, pp. 323-4 and 5. We may add that the "fine elastic bristles,"
mentioned by Dr. Tyndall, are known to be prolongations of the free
ends of the epithelial cells. The <em>other</em> ends of these cells&mdash;(<i>i.e.</i> the deep
or attached ends) are delicately ramified, and are said to be in connection
with slender nerve-fibrils.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_BE_276" id="Footnote_BE_276"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BE_276"><span class="label">[be]</span></a> The reader may be pleased to recal Professor Huxley's two
necessary beliefs&mdash;necessary, that is, for making the world we live in
less miserable and less ignorant. First, that the Order of Nature is
practically ascertainable. Secondly, that our Volition counts for something
as a condition in the course of Events. (<cite>Lay Sermons</cite>, p. 159,&mdash;already
quoted pp. 247 and 8 <i>ante</i>.)
</p>
<p>
Evidently, to count for <em>anything</em>, Volition must produce <em>effects</em>; that
is, cause certain <em>changes</em> in the natural order of things. This principle,
therefore, is clearly asserted by the Professor,&mdash;and its consequences
follow by logical necessity, as here deduced.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Huxley's idea of the Order of Nature is also coincident with the
view of it taken in this Chapter.
</p>
<p>
The present writer is glad to mark these undesigned coincidences of
thought. "Lay Sermons" had not reached him when this Essay was
sent to the Oxford Registrar. Neither had he seen the Professor's
Article in the Fortnightly Review.
</p>
<p>
<i>Addition.</i>&mdash;The doctrine in most complete antagonism with Mr. Huxley's
position is described as follows by Dr. Carpenter:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The most thorough-going expression of this doctrine will be found
in the 'Letters of the Laws of Man's Nature and Development,' by Henry
G. Atkinson and Harriet Martineau. A few extracts will suffice to show
the character of this system of Philosophy. 'Instinct, passion, thought,
etc., are effects of organized substances.' 'All causes are material causes.'
'In material conditions I find the origin of all religions, all philosophies,
all opinions, all virtues, all "spiritual conditions and influences," in the
same manner that I find the origin of all diseases and of all insanities in
material conditions and causes.' 'I am what I am; a creature of
necessity; I claim neither merit nor demerit.' 'I feel that I am as
completely the result of my nature, and impelled to do what I do, as the
needle to point to the north, or the puppet to move according as the
string is pulled.' 'I cannot alter my will, or be other than what I am,
and cannot deserve either reward or punishment.'" Carpenter. <cite>Mental
Physiology</cite>, p. 4.</p></div>
